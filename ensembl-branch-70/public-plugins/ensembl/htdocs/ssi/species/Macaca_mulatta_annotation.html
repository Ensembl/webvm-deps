<p>The gene set for macaque was built using the Ensembl pipeline. The 
species-specific resources for macaque are relatively limited, so we 
decided to take a combined approach utilizing macaque's great similarity 
to human to aid our annotation efforts. The gene structures are mainly 
based on alignments to human and macaque protein data. Both macaque and 
human cDNAs were used to add UTR structures, and finally gene 
predictions based on Uniprot proteins and human cdnas were used to fill 
gaps in the annotation.</p>
