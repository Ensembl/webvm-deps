<p>
The gene set was built using a mixed approach. Due to the lack of species specific 
sequences and the availability of RNASeq data for Chinese softshell turtle from RIKEN 
and <a href="http://www.genomics.cn/en/index">BGI</a> Institutes, the final gene set 
comprises of models based orthologous proteins from the vertebrate division of UniProtKB 
in addition to models from RNASeq data. The RNASeq data contained samples from 
TK7, TK9, TK11, TK13, TK15, TK17, TK23, gastrula and neurula developmental stages, 
together with pooled data set and combined data from all nine stages. 8,070 gene models
were made exclusively from RNASeq data. The data was also used to add UTR to gene models. 
The total gene set contains 18,188 protein coding genes with a further 1,018 ncRNAs and 97 pseudogenes.

<h3>RNASeq data set</h3>

<p>
In addition to the main set, we have predicted gene models for each tissue 
type using the RNASeq pipeline. We did a BLASTp of these models against UniProt proteins with 
protein existence level 1 and 2 in order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF). The best 
BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting evidence.

The tissue-specific sets of transcript models built using our RNAseq pipeline are as follows:
