<p>
Felis_catus-6.2 was annotated using a standard Ensembl mammalian
genebuild pipeline, incorporating RNA-seq data provided by <a
href="http://vetmed.tamu.edu/">The Texas A&M College of Veterinary
Medicine & Biomedical Sciences</a>, Department of Veterinary Integrative
Biosciences.  The final gene set is made up from 19493 protein coding
genes, 542 pseudogenes, and 1855 non-coding RNA genes.

<h3>RNASeq data set</h3>

<p>
As part of the main gene set, we have predicted gene models based on
RNA-seq data from testis tissue of four individuals (unpaired 50bp
reads) using the RNA-Seq pipeline.  We did similarity matching (BLASTp)
of these models against UniProt proteins having evidence of existence
on protein or transcript level (protein existence level 1 and 2) in
order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF).  A total of 3504 RNA-seq
transcript models were used in the final gene set.  The data was also
used to add UTR to gene models.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the main gene set, the Ensembl RNA-seq pipeline built the
following numbers of gene models for each of the four individuals and
for the merged data set:
