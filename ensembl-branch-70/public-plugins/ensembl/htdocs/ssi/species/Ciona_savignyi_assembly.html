<p>The genome of a single <i>Ciona savignyi</i> from 
San Francisco Bay was shotgun-sequenced by the Broad Institute and 
assembled using Arachne2. The Sidow lab at Stanford used this as a 
basis for the <a href="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/ciona.html" rel="external">assembly</a>.</p>

<p>
  The assembly consists of 374 Reftigs, totalling 174 Megabases, with a Contig N50 of 141Kb and Reftig N50 size of 1800Kb.
