Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was 
necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" 
super-structures,in order to present complete genes. There are 4903 
such gene scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".

<i>Microcebus murinus</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>).
 A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian species.

 Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals and used in alignments for cross-species comparison.  The aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the human genome.
