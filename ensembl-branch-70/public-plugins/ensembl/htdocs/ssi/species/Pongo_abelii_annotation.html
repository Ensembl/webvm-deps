<p>
Due to the high sequence similarity to the human genome, the Orangutan 
genebuild was based on a projection of human gene structures. 
The projections were made through chained whole 
genome BLASTz alignments. These projected genes were combined with 
orangutan-specific proteins, and additional human genes were added using 
exonerate where the projection was unable to make satisfactory gene 
models. UTRs were added using orangutan-specific ESTs and cDNAs as well as 
human cDNAs.
