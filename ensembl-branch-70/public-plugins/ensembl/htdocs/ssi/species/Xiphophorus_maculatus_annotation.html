<p>XipMac4.4.2 was annotated using the Ensembl genebuild pipeline. Gene models are based on</p>
<ul>
  <li>Genewise alignments of UniProt protein sequences from platyfish</li>
  <li>Models build from platyfish RNASeq data using our in-house RNASeq pipeline</li>
  <li>Genewise alignments of UniProt protein sequences from other fish and vertebrate species</li>
  <li>Exonerate alignments of Ensembl Stickleback and Zebrafish proteins from Ensembl release 65</li>
</ul>
<p>Protein-coding models were extended into their untranslated regions using RNASeq models. In addition to the coding transcript models, non-coding RNAs and pseudogenes were annotated.</p>
