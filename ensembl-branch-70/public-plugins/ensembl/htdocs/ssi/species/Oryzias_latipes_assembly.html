<p>The Japanese medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>) genome, 
which has been  sequenced by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and by using the
Ramen assembler, is approximately  700Mb in length and comprises 24 pairs of 
chromosomes; 2 metacentric, 8 submetacentric, 1 subtelocentric and 13 acrocentric 
chromosomes in haploid condition. The genome sequencing and assembly for MEDAKA1 
(October 2005) were provided by the 
<a href=" http://dolphin.lab.nig.ac.jp/medaka/">National Institute of Genetics</a> (NIG)
and the <a href="http://medaka.utgenome.org/">University of Tokyo</a>.</p>

<p>This Ensembl website presents sequence data provided by the two  
institutes. It also displays their gene set together with the Ensembl gene set 
and related analysis.
