<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was 
necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" 
super-structures, in order to present complete genes. There are 8139 
such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".</p>

<h3>Mammalian Genome Project</h3>

<p><i>Choloepus hoffmanni</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded
by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>). A
group of species were chosen to maximise the branch length of
the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian
species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals
and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The aim is to
increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the
human genome.</p>
