The horse EquCab2 was annotated using a standard Ensembl mammalian 
pipeline. Predictions from vertebrate mammals as well as horse proteins 
have been given priority over predictions from non-mammalian vertebrates.  
1:1 homologous genes in human and mouse were aligned to the 
horse genome using Exonerate. Alignments were compared to the set of 
predicted genes in horse to patch the horse gene set. Horse genes which 
had only been partially predicted previously were extended by additional 
exons. Single genes which had been mis-annotated as two distinct 
neighbouring genes were merged. Missing homologues in horse were also 
recovered.   Horse and human cDNAs have been used to add UTRs to protein 
based predictions. The final gene-set comprises 20,436 protein-coding 
genes and 4400 pseudogenes (including retrotranposed genes).
