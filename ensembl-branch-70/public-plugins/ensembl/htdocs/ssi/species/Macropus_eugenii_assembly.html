<p>This is the first release of the 2x wallaby (<i>Macropus eugenii</i>) genome assembly Meug_1.0 (GCA_000004035.1). The genome was sequenced by the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/project-species-m-Wallaby.hgsc?pageLocation=Wallaby">Human Genome Sequencing Center</a> Baylor College of Medicine which, along with the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd., is part of the Tammar Wallaby Genome Sequencing Consortium.</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. For the contigs in the assembly the N50 size is 2.5 kb and for the scaffolds 14.5 kb. The total length of all of the contigs in the assembly is 2.55 Gb with the assembly spanning 2.78 Gb.</p>
