<p>
The gene set for ground squirrel was built using the Ensembl pipeline.
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of squirrel and mammal 
proteins as well as genetically distant proteins from other species, 
including most vertebrate proteins from Uniprot. Additionally, mouse and 
human ensembl translations were aligned using exonerate and genewise. 
The protein based gene models were then extended using mouse cDNA.
In addition to the coding transcript models, non-coding RNAs and 
pseudogenes were annotated.

<h3>Mammalian Genome Project</h3>
<p><i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus </i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part
of the Mammalian Genome Project, funded by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch
length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of
mammalian species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for
these mammals and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The
aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially
in the human genome.
