The gene set for anole lizard was built using the Ensembl genebuild 
pipeline. Gene models are based on genewise alignments of chicken 
proteins as well as genetically distant proteins from other species, 
including most vertebrates from Uniprot. To improve the accuracy of 
models generated from distant species, the Genewise alignments were made 
to stretches of genomic sequence rather than to 'miniseqs'. The protein 
based gene models were then extended using anole lizard cDNA and EST 
alignments as well as chicken cDNA. Potentially missing predictions and 
partial gene predictions were identified by examining the human-chicken 
one-to-one orthologs, which were then used to build new gene models.
