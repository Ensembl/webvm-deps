<p>The data displayed on the Ensembl Fruitfly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> site is a compendium of data from different sources, including <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/">BDGP</a>, <a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> and <a href="http://www.dhgp.org/">DHGP</a>.
The genomic sequence is the <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/sequence/release5genomic.shtml">BDGP assembly, release 5</a> (April 2006), and the annotations are imported from <a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> release 5.39 (FB2011_07, dated 21 July 2011). No additional gene build has been carried out, however blast hits and protein features have been computed through the Ensembl pipeline.</p>

<p>We have included <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> into Ensembl to allow people to access the Fruitfly genome through the Ensembl user interface (both for visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration through our comparative genomics resources (such as homologous, gene trees and families).</p>

<p>The canonical data for Drosophila is managed at <a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> and we are working in partnership with them to provide feedback on their resources.</p>

<h3>Variation Data</h3>

<p>
The Ensembl Fruitfly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> variation database has been produced using data from <a href="http://www.dpgp.org/1K_50genomes.html#Reference_Release_1.0">release 1.0</a> of the "50 genomes" data set from the <a href="http://www.dpgp.org">Drosophila Population Genome Project</a>. The data set contains over 6.7 million SNPs from two populations, one comprising 37 lines from north Carolina and the other comprising 15 lines from Malawi. The DPGP data has been released in advance of publication and the consortium has requested that users of these data (both Release 0.5 and Release 1.0) defer publication for six (6) months after the appearance of Release 1.0 (see the <a href="http://www.dpgp.org/1K_50genomes.html#Reference_Release_1.0">release notes</a> for more information).
