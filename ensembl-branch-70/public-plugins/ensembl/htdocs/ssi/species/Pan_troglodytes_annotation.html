<p>The genome was aligned to human GRCh37 using BLASTz in an eHive pipeline. These
alignments were used to transfer human ensembl gene structures (Human Build 63)
to chimpanzee. 97.7% of the chimp-specific proteins were aligned to the chimp
genome in a first layer of annotation. The missing proteins mainly contain
multiple internal stop codons in the assembled genome.</p>

<p>1371 chimp-specific protein sequences were used during the gene build
process and were aligned using a combination of Genewise and Exonerate. Owing to the
small number of proteins (some of which aligned in the same location) an
additional layer of gene structures was added by projection of human genes. The
high-quality annotation of the human genome and the high degree of similarity
between the human and chimpanzee genomes enables us to identify genes in
chimpanzee by transfer of human genes to the corresponding location in chimp.</p>

<p>The protein-coding transcripts of the human gene structures are projected
through the Whole Genome Alignment (WGA) onto the chromosomes in the chimp
genome. Small insertions/deletions that disrupt the reading-frame of the
resultant transcripts are corrected for by inserting "frame-shift" introns into the structure.</p>

<p>For some human exons and parts of exons, the corresponding chimp sequence is
missing from the assembly. In most of these cases, the missing exon is omitted from the chimpanzee gene model. In a small number of cases however,
where BLASTZ has aligned the human sequence to a gap in the chimp sequence, the exon is
placed in the gap, resulting on a run of X's of the correct length in the
translation. Some human transcripts fail to transfer cleanly (due to, for example,
missing alignment in the othologous regions). We have attempted to recover these
using Exonerate. The single best exonerate alignment to chimp is chosen for each
"missing" human transcript, and transcripts with less that 90% identity to the
source or 60% coverage of the source are discarded.</p>

<p>The final data set includes 18746 protein coding genes.</p>

<p>RNA-seq data was provided by Henrik Kaessmann from the University of Lausanne, after gene annotation was complete. These data were aligned to the genome using BWA. We used our in-house RNA-seq pipeline to build gene models based on these alignments. Both the original BAM files and the additional gene models can be viewed in LocationView. The RNA-seq based gene models have not yet been added into the default chimpanzee gene set.</p>
