<p>For the taeGut3.2.4 assembly, the predicted gene set contains 18,447 
gene models, of which 17,475 are protein coding genes. The gene set was 
built using a modified version of the standard EnsEMBL genebuild 
pipeline. Unusually, some genes relying on EST evidence were included in 
the gene set. The evidence used to construct the gene set included 
alignments of EnsEMBL chicken proteins, alignments of other avian 
proteins and mammal protein alignments, in addition to zebra finch evidence.</p>

<p>In Ensembl release 67, the zebra finch gene set was updated by including the
      zebra finch mitochondrial (MT) annotation. The sequence and annotation for
      MT was added using the NCBI record <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/DQ422742.1">DQ422742.1</a>.
