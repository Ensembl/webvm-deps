The <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/">zebrafish genome project</a> 
is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and the zebrafish community, announced during the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2000/001121.shtml">Sanger Institute Zebrafish Workshop 2000</a> 
and was started in February 2001.

<p>
Zv9 (GCA_000002035.2) is the ninth integrated assembly 
of the zebrafish genome. This assembly is used by UCSC to create their danRer7 
database. It is based on nearly 90% clone sequence (data freeze April 2010), 
with remaining gaps being filled using sequence from a novel whole genome shotgun 
assembly, WGS31. The project coordination, genome sequencing and assembly is 
provided by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

An overview of the assembly is available <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv9_assembly_information.shtml">here</a>, 
and frequently asked questions about the assembly process and terminology are addressed <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/faqs.shtml">here</a>.
