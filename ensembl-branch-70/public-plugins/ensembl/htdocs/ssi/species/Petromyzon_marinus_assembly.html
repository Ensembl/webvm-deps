Petromyzon_marinus_7.0 is an assembly of the sea lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>) 
provided by the lamprey consortium. It was sequenced to a total of 5.0X whole 
genome coverage. The combined WGS and BAC-end sequence reads were assembled 
using Arachne V3.2. The expected genome size is 1.92 gb. The N50 size is the 
length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size 
or longer. The N50 size of scaffolds is 184.619 kb. The total of all scaffolds 
is 885Mb
