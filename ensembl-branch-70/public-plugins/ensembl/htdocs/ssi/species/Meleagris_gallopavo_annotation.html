<p>
The gene set for turkey was built using the Ensembl genebuild pipeline. 
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of chicken proteins as well 
as genetically distant proteins from other species, including most 
vertebrates from Uniprot. To improve the accuracy of models generated 
from distant species, the Genewise alignments were made to stretches of 
genomic sequence rather than to 'miniseqs'. The protein based gene 
models were then extended using turkey cDNA and EST alignments as well 
as chicken cDNA. Potentially missing predictions and partial gene 
predictions were identified by examining the human-chicken one-to-one 
orthologs, which were then used to build new gene models.
