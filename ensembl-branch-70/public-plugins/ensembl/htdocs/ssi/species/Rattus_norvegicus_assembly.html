<p>This site displays annotation on version 5.0 (March 2012) of the rat 
(strain BN/SsNHsdMCW) genome assembly, known as 'Rnor_5.0' submitted from 
the <a href="https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/content/rat-genome-project">Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium</a>.</p>

<p>This assembly is based on a 6X WGS sequence approach, as used for the 
mouse genome, and the hierarchical (BAC clone) approach used for the human 
genome. It is composed of 2738 toplevel sequences, of which 21 are chromosomes, 
1278 are unlocalized scaffolds and 1439 are unplaced scaffolds. There are 
112,652 contigs with an N50 length of 59.5kb, and 10,848 scaffolds with an 
N50 length of 2.18Mb.</p>
