<p>
The gene set was built using a mixed approach. First the Ensembl pipeline was used to generate 264,684 models from orthologous vertebrate
proteins from UniprotKB with a protein existence level of 1 or 2. Then, due to the lack of species specific sequences and the availability
of RNA-Seq for ferret, we used 1.1G paired-end reads sequenced by the Broad Institute. The RNA-Seq data contains tissues from a male ferret,
from a female ferret, from an influenza infected ferret and from different developmental stage. We pooled the tissues to avoid creating too
many fragmented models. Using the RNA-Seq pipeline, we created 22,299 models from the pooled set. When a pooled model was missing but we had
a consensus with the tissues models, the consensus model was added to the pooled set, which brought the number of RNA-Seq models up to 24,837.
By combining the orthologous set, the RNA-Seq set and our ncRNA pipeline we built the final gene set: 19910 protein coding gene models, 270
pseudogenes, 17 retrotransposed and 3,614 non coding RNA.

<h3>RNASeq data set</h3>

<p>
In addition to the main set, we have predicted gene models for each tissue type using the RNA-Seq pipeline.
We did a BLASTp of these models against UniProt proteins of protein existence level 1 and 2 in order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF).
The best BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting evidence.
