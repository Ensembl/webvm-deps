Callithrix jacchus-3.2.1 (GCA_000004665.1) is a draft assembly of the 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Callithrix%20jacchus">common marmoset genome</a>.
This assembly is used by UCSC to create their calJac3 database.
 It was sequenced to 6X coverage using a female marmoset (animal id #186/17066) DNA source kindly 
provided by Dr. Suzette Tardif, of the  <a href="http://www.sfbr.org/SNPRC/index.aspx">Southwestern National Primate Research Center</a> 
(San Antonio, Texas). The DNA source for the CHORI-259 BAC library was male and the full brother of the 
female used for whole genome shotgun sequencing (#186/17066). The combined sequence reads were assembled 
using the PCAP software <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952883">(Genome Res. 13(9):2164-70 2003)</a> 
and filtered for all known non-marmoset sequence contaminants.

The new Callithrix jacchus-3.2.1 assembly spans 2.75Gb with 2.62Gb ordered and oriented along 24 chromosomes. Chromosomes were not available in Callithrix jacchus-3.2 (released in Ensembl 56 and Ensembl 57), which was composed of scaffolds and contigs only.

<p>
The N50 length is defined as the scaffold (or contig) length N for which 50% of the genome lies in scaffolds (or contigs) of the N50 size or longer. The Callithrix jacchus-3.2.1 assembly is made up of a total of 73,756 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold length of over 6.4Mb. Scaffolds placed on chromosomes have been annotated as described below.
