<p>
The gene set for bushbaby was built using the Ensembl pipeline.
</p>

<p>
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of bushbaby and primate proteins as well as genetically 
distant proteins from other species, including most vertebrate proteins from Uniprot. Additionally, 
human ensembl translations were aligned using exonerate and genewise. The protein based gene models 
were then extended using human cDNA.
In addition to the coding transcript models, non-coding RNAs and pseudogenes were annotated.
