<h1>Family and GeneTree stable ID in Compara</h1>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>We provide Stable IDs for both Families and GeneTrees. The IDs are kept from one release to the other depending on the
genes present in the Family or Gene Tree. In particular, we do not rely on the underlying alignment, the tree structure or
the resulting orthologs to assign stable IDs to GeneTrees.</p>

<h2 id="Namespaces">Namespaces</h2>

<p>The format of the Stable IDs are <b>ENSFMRRRRXXXXXXXXXX</b> and <b>ENSGTRRRRXXXXXXXXXX</b>
respectively, where RRRR corresponds to the Ensembl release number when the stable ID was first assigned and XXXXXXXXXX
is a number. For instance, ENSFM00550000743120 is a family first described in Ensembl 55 and ENSGT00560000077204 is a GeneTree first
described in Ensembl 56.</p>


<h2 id="Algorithm">Stable ID mapping</h2>

<p>This is a generic description of the Stable ID mapping algorithm. We use it to track stable IDs from release to release,
but we also use it to match Ensembl GeneTrees to TreeFam entries.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm takes two different classification schemes (i.e. Families
from the current release and Families from the forthcoming one) over a given
set of members.  It is assumed that the classifications are somehow
related, i.e. they tend to group members similarly. One is called
<b>"old"</b> and the other <b>"new"</b>, given an order of succession.
</p>

<p>
The comparison requires a common namespace for the members used in
both classifications.  The algorithm then infers how the names of the
classes in two different classifications are related.
</p>

<p>
Member Namespaces:
</p>

<ul>
<li>EnsemblCompara GeneTrees
<ul>
<li>Common ENSEMBL translation stable_ids (ENSEMBLPEP) from release to release</li>
<li>Common ENSEMBL transcript stable_ids between GeneTrees and Treefam families</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>EnsemblCompara MCL Families
<ul>
<li>Common Compara ENSEMBLPEP, Uniprot/SWISSPROT and Uniprot/SPTREML ids from release to release</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
With respect to the two given classifications, we have three kinds of members:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>SHARED</b> members (the ones present in both classifications)</li>
<li><b>DISAPPEARING</b> members (the ones present only in the <b>"old"</b> classification)
- e.g. for the GeneTrees, gene predictions or complete genomes that disappear in the next release</li>
<li><b>NEWBORN</b> members (the ones present only in the <b>"new"</b> classification).
- e.g. for the GeneTrees, new gene predictions or new complete genomes in the next release</li>
</ul>

<p>
The relationship between classes is inferred from the <b>SHARED</b> members,
but the other two kinds are also counted by the algorithm.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm iterates through the <b>"new"</b> classes in the descending
order of their sizes, trying to reuse a name of one of the <b>"old"</b>
classes from where the <b>SHARED</b> members come to the <b>"new"</b> class, and
make it the name of the <b>"new"</b> class, if it has not been taken yet.
</p>

<p>If 100% <b>SHARED</b> members of the <b>"old"</b> class become 100% <b>SHARED</b> members
of the new class, we call this case an <b>EXACT</b> reuse.
If there was only one <b>SHARED</b> member, we call it an <b>EXACT_o</b> for "orphan".
</p>

<p>Otherwise we have a split/join situation and iterate through the
  "contributors" (the <b>"old"</b> classes from which the <b>SHARED</b> members come
  from) in the decreasing order of the sizes of the shared parts.
  This ordering ensures that both in cases of joins and splits we are
  reusing the name of the biggest contributor.
</p>


<ul>
<li>If the <b>"old"</b> class name of the first (the biggest) part has not yet
  been taken, we take it and call this a <b>MAJORITY</b> reuse.  Due to the
  ordering (and looking at the statistics) this type of name reuse
  usually means that the <b>SHARED</b> majority of the biggest <b>"old"</b>
  contributor becomes the <b>SHARED</b> majority of the <b>"new"</b> class.
  If there was only one <b>SHARED</b> member, we call it an <b>MAJORITY_o</b> for
  "orphan", although this will rarely happen.
</li>

<li>If the <b>"old"</b> class name of the first part has been taken, but one of
  the other <b>"old"</b> class names is still available, we take it and call it a
  <b>NEXTBEST</b> name.  (these classes are usually very small, because the
  majority of the <b>SHARED</b> members participate in <b>EXACT/MAJORITY</b> cases).
</li>

<li>If a name could not have been reused, because all the <b>"old"</b>
  contributor's names have been used, a completely new name is
  generated and it is a <b>NEWNAME</b> case. This usually means we are dealing
  with a split of a big class, where the majority has gone into an <b>MAJORITY</b>,
  and the rest of it needs a new name. Again, if there was only one <b>SHARED</b>
  member, we call it <b>NEWNAME_o</b>.
</li>

<li>Finally, if we have a <b>"new"</b> class that only contains <b>NEWBORN</b> members
(meaning there were no <b>"old"</b> classes to reuse the names from), a
new name is also generated, but this is a <b>NEWFAM</b> case. If the new class has only
one (<b>NEWBORN</b>) member, it is a <b>NEWFAM_o</b> case.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this example diagram:
</p>
<p><img style="width: 637px; height: 574px;" alt="stable_id_mapping" src="compara_stable_id_mapping.png" /></p>

<ul>
<li>D1 is an <b>EXACT</b> reuse (cyan contributor)</li>
<li>A2 inherits the name from A1 according to the <b>MAJORITY</b> rule (light red contributor)</li>
<li>B2 inherits the name from B1 (pink contributor), and C1 name disappears in the new classification and it is merged into B2 (light green).</li>
<li>Z1 is created from <b>NEWBORN</b> members</li>
<li>Y1 is an example of <b>NEWNAME</b> (yellow contributor)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Versioning">Versioning</h2>

<p>
A version increase indicates that the <b>SHARED</b> members have changed for
that class. The version is kept the same if it is an <b>EXACT</b> reuse
case. For example, in the GeneTrees:
</p>

<p>
a) If a genetree with 50 members in release 56 turns into a genetree
with 49+2 members in release 57, 49 being <b>SHARED</b> and 2 being <b>NEWBORN</b>,
the version will change.
</p>

<p>
b) If a genetree with 50 members in release 56 turns into a genetree
with 48+2 members in release 57, 48 being <b>SHARED</b> and 2 being <b>NEWBORN</b>,
the version will change, even though the total number of members is
the same.
</p>

<p>
c) If a genetree with 48+2 members in release 56 turns into a genetree
with 48 members in release 57, 48 being <b>SHARED</b> and 2 being
<b>DISAPPEARING</b> (e.g. updated genebuild that deletes some members), the
version will be the same.
</p>

<p>
d) If a genetree with 48+2 members in release 56 turns into a genetree
with 48+3 members in release 57, 48 being <b>SHARED</b>, 2 being <b>DISAPPEARING</b>
and 3 being <b>NEWBORN</b>, the version will be the same.
