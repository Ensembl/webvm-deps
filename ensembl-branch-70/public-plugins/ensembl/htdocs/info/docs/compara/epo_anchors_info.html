<h2>The EPO pipeline is split into 3 parts</h2>

<h3>1). Anchor generation</h3>
<ul>
The anchors represent short regions of conservation, typically about 100 bases in length, from a phylogenetically representative subset of the species we wish to align.

<p>The anchor set is generated from pairwise alignments (blastz_net and/or lastz_net) of a non-reference species to a reference species (human is the reference in our case), so all the species chosen to generate the anchors must have a pairwise alignment with the reference species. <br />
We then use the alignment coordinates from the reference genome to find sets of overlapping sequences from the chosen pairwise alignments.<br />
See a list of the <a href="/info/docs/compara/analyses.html" class="bold">pairwise alignments</a> in Ensembl
</ul>

<h3>2). Anchor mapping</h3>
<ul>
The anchor set is mapped (currently we use exonerate) against all the genomes we wish to include in the final alignment.<br />
Overlapping anchor mappings are filtered so that any particular genomic location is associated with, at most, one anchor.  
</ul>


<h3>3). Graph generation using Enredo followed by Alignment using Pecan/Ortheus</h3>
<ul>
Enredo produces a list of homologous genomic regions from the positions where the anchors have mapped.<br /> 
These homologous regions are then aligned with Pecan or Ortheus (Ortheus uses Pecan to do the aligning and also generates a sequence for each ancestral node in a tree which it predicts for each region).
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<p>Not all parts of the pipeline may be run for each Ensembl release, for instance we may only have to generate a new set of anchors infrequently.
</p>

<p>Mapping of the anchors to the genomes takes the most time, however, it is a cumulative process (for each new genome, we need
only map the anchors to it and add these mappings to the set of mappings which were done in previous releases).
</p>

<p>Aligning the sequences is done anew with each release (assuming there is a new species added or an updated assembly)
</p>
<p>The following pipeconfig files (~/ensembl-compara/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Compara/PipeConfig)<br />
are used for setting up the <a href="/info/docs/eHive/index.html" class="bold">eHive</a> for running the 3 pipeline stages:<br />
1) anchor generation : GenerateAnchors_conf.pm<br />
2) anchor mapping : MapAnchors_conf.pm<br />
3) graph generation followed by aligning : EPO_conf.pm<br />
</p>
For the current release the following set of species were used to generate the anchor set used for the mammalian and primate EPO alignments :<br />
