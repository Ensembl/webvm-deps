<h1>eHive production system</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a distributed processing system based on 'autonomous agents' and the
behavioural structure of honey bees.  It implements all functionality of both
data-flow graphs and block-branch diagrams which should allow it to codify
any program, algorithm, or parallel processing job control system.  It is
not bound to any processing 'farm' system and can be adapted to any GRID.

A pipeline is defined by a set of initial <i>jobs</i>
and a graph whose nodes are <i>analyses</i> ("types" of jobs)
and whose arcs represent <i>dataflow rules</i> (rules that control how running jobs generate new jobs)
and <i>analysis control rules</i> (rules that block jobs of one analysis until all jobs of another analysis have completed).
