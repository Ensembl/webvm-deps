<h2>Linking to the Archive Ensembl sites</h2>

<p>The Archive Ensembl sites,
(e.g. <strong>http://nov2008.archive.ensembl.org</strong>), have the format:
<kbd>http://&lt;three-letter-month&gt;&lt;year&gt;.archive.ensembl.org</kbd>
</p>


<p>In the footer of each <a href="http://www.ensembl.org" rel="external">current Ensembl</a> 
page, there is a link called 'Permanent link', which links to the
corresponding page in the Ensembl Archive. A similar link on each
archive page links back to the current site (i.e. www.ensembl.org). Note that
in archives released prior to the site redesign in Version 51, these links are
in the purple lefthand navigation bar.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, owing to the change in site organisation between releases 50 and 51, 
it is not always possible to map pages one-to-one between the current Ensembl site and 
the older archives. If the link does not take you to the data you expected, trying using 
the search facility to locate the information.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>If you are looking at the Alternative Splicing view for human gene BRCA2 on the
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/" rel="external">main Ensembl site</a> in September 2008, when Ensembl 51 
was the current version, the URL would be:</p>
<p><kbd><a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152">http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152</a> </kbd></p>

<p>and the equivalent archived page URL would be:</p>
<p><kbd><a href="http://nov2008.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152">http://nov2008.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152</a></kbd></p>
