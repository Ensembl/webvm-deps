<h1>File locations and links</h1>

<p>The Ensembl webcode now parses certain areas of the static content to enable 
automation creation of navigation links. It is therefore essential that you 
do not put content in the wrong place!</p>

<p>Points to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anything within an <kbd>htdocs/info/</kbd> folder in <strong>any</strong> plugin 
will be automagically added to the documentation sitemap</li> 

<li>Technical documentation about the website code and API, and methods for accessing
data using the website or API, should go in the top-level <kbd>/htdocs/info/</kbd> directory, 
as it is relevant to any Ensembl-based installation</li>

<li>Documentation about the data produced specifically for www.ensembl.org, e.g.
genebuild methods and additional data access, should be placed in
<kbd>public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/</kbd></li>

<li>Before adding a page to a plugin, please check if there is an existing folder hierarchy 
in <kbd>htdocs</kbd> or <kbd>public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs</kbd>, as this will help to keep 
related content together.</li> 

<li>Please do not make relative links to articles outside the content you control, e.g. 
'../../about/contact.html', as these links are hard to trace when they break. Instead 
use absolute links from the top of the document tree, e.g. '/info/about/contact.html' 
(relative links to files in the same directory or in subdirectories are OK). </li>

<li>Please do not hard-code links to www.ensembl.org unless there is a pressing reason, 
as it can cause problems in archives. We use some full URLs for things like contact pages,
where we want visitors to archives to use the most up-to-date information, but for the
most part this should be avoided.</li> 
</ul>
