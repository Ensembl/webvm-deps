<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>
Gene annotation in gorilla has been generated by projection of genes from the human 
reference genome as well as alignment of proteins from three major sources (in 
descending order of their contribution to the final gene set):
</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensembl human translations from Ensembl release 56</li>
<li>Uniprot mammalian and vertebrate proteins with evidence at either the protein 
or transcript level for their existence; and</li>
<li><em>Gorilla gorilla</em> proteins obtained from UniprotKB.</li>
</ol>

<p class="space-below">
Projection of human genes to gorilla began with the alignment of gorilla
genome to the latest human reference genome (GRCh37 assembly) using
BLASTz. These alignments were used to project human Ensembl gene
structures (Ensembl version 56) to the corresponding location in
gorilla. About 60% of human protein-coding genes were projected onto the
gorilla genome. Small insertions/deletions that disrupt the
reading-frame of the resultant projected transcripts are corrected for
by inserting "frame-shift" introns into the structure. For some human
exons and parts of exons, the corresponding gorilla sequence is missing
from the assembly. In most of these cases, the missing exon is omitted
from the gorilla gene model. In a small number of cases however, where
BLASTz has aligned the human sequence to a gap in the gorilla sequence,
the exon is placed in the gap, resulting in a run of X's of the correct
length in the translation.

Ensembl human translations were also aligned to the gorilla genome using
Exonerate. The alignment of mammalian/vertebrate proteins and
gorilla-specific proteins followed procedures in the standard Ensembl
genebuild pipeline using Genewise.

The gene-building procedure on the gorGor3 assembly identified 20803
protein coding genes and 1553 pseudogenes.
