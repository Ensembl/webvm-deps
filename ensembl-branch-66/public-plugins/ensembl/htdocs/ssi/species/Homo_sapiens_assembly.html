This site provides a data set based on the February 2009 
<i>Homo sapiens</i> high coverage assembly GRCh37 (GCA_000001405.6) from the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium</a>.
This assembly is used by UCSC to create their hg19 database.
The data set consists of gene models built from the genewise alignments 
of the human proteome as well as from alignments of human cDNAs using 
the cDNA2genome model of exonerate.</p>
<p class="space-below">This release of the assembly has the following properties: </p>
<ul style="margin-left:150px">
    <li>27478 contigs.</li>
    <li>contig length total 3.2 Gb.</li>
    <li>chromosome length total 3.1 Gb.</li>
</ul>
<p class="space-below">It also includes nine <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206249/?tool=pubmed">haplotypic regions</a>, 
mainly in the MHC region of chromosome 6.</p>

<p>As the GRC maintains and improves the assembly, patches are being introduced. Patch release six (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/human/index.shtml">GRCh37</a>.p6) was included in Ensembl release 66. Currently, assembly patches are of two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Novel patch: new sequences that add alternative sequence at a loci 
and will remain as haplotypes in the next major assembly release by GRC</li>
<li>Fix patch: sequences that correct the reference sequence and will 
replace the given region of the reference assembly at the next major 
assembly release by GRC</li>
</ul>
