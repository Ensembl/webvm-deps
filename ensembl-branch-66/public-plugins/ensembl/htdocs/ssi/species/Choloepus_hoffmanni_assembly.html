This is the first release of the low-coverage 2.05X assembly of the 
two-toed sloth  (<i>Choloepus hoffmanni</i>). The genome sequencing and 
assembly is provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/node/347">Broad Institute</a>.</p>

<p class="space-below">The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies 
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The contigs have an N50 length of 
2461 bp and 8.6 kb for supercontigs. The total number of bases in 
supercontigs is 2.34 Gb and in contigs is 1.95 Gb.</p>
