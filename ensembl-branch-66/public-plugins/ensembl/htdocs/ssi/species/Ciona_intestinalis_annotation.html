<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">The standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline was modified for annotation of 
the <i>Ciona</i> genome, owing to the lack of genomic information from 
closely related species. Thus, in addition to aligning known <i>Ciona</i> 
proteins to
the genome sequence (as per the standard pipeline), the large quantities
of Ciona-specific cDNA and EST sequences were aligned against the genome
and then protein data from other species was used to build additional
gene models.</p>
<p>
In addition to the coding transcript models, non-coding RNAs and
pseudogenes were annotated.</p>
