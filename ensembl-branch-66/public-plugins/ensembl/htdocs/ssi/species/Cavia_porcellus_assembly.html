This is the first release of the high-coverage 6.79X assembly of the
Guinea Pig (<i>Cavia porcellus</i>). The genome sequencing
and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.

<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for contigs is 80.58 kb and the N50 of the supercontigs is 27.41 Mb. The total length of all contigs is 2.66 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in chromosomes are included, the total span of the assembly is 2.72 Gb.
