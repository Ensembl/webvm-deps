<p class="space-below">A standard Ensembl projection build was carried out 
whereby genes from the latest human gene set (from release 49) were projected 
onto the cat assembly.</p>

<p> Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was 
necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" super-structures, 
in order to present complete genes. There are 5280 such gene-scaffolds, with 
identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1". It should be noted that for this 
projection genebuild a combination of human and dog genes were used, where 
dog genes were used to fill gaps where no human gene had been projected onto 
the cat sequence.</p>

<h3>Mammalian Genome Project</h3>

<p><i>Felis catus</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded 
by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>). A 
group of species were chosen to maximise the branch length of
the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian
species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals
and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The aim is to
increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the
human genome.</p>
