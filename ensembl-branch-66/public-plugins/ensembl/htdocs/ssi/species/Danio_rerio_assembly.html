<p>The <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/">zebrafish
genome project</a> is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and
the zebrafish community, announced during the <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2000/001121.shtml">Sanger Institute
Zebrafish Workshop 2000</a> and was started in February 2001.</p>

<p class="space-below">Zv9 (GCA_000002035.2) is the ninth integrated assembly 
of the zebrafish genome. This assembly is used by UCSC to create their danRer7 
database. It is based on nearly 90% clone sequence (data freeze April 2010), 
with remaining gaps being filled using sequence from a novel whole genome shotgun 
assembly, WGS31. The project coordination, genome sequencing and assembly is 
provided by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>

<p>An overview of the assembly is available <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv9_assembly_information.shtml">here</a>, and frequently asked 
questions about the assembly process and terminology are addressed <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/faqs.shtml">here</a>.</p>
