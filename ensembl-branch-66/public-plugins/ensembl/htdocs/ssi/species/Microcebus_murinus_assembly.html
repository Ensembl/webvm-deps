<p>
This is the first release of the low-coverage 1.93X assembly of the
mouse lemur (<i>Microcebus murinus</i>). The genome sequencing and assembly is
provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies 
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 
107.02 kb and is 3.51 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in 
supercontigs is 2.89 Gb and in contigs is 1.85 Gb.
