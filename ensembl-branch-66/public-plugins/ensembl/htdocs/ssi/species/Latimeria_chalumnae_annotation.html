<h3>Annotation</h3>
<p> 
The Ensembl genome annotation pipeline was used to identify genes. Models built from Coelacanth proteins and cDNAs have been given priority over predictions from other vertebrate species. 4,889 transcript models made from paired end Illumina RNA-Seq were added into the gene set where they added a novel model or splice variant. RNA-Seq data was also used to add UTR to non species specific models. The total gene set contains 19,033 protein coding genes with a further 2,894 ncRNAs and 141 pseudogenes.
