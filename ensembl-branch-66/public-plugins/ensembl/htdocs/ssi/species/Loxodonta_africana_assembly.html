<p class="space-below">loxAfr3 is an assembly 
of the genome of the African Elephant (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>),
sequenced to 7x coverage.  
The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>.</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome
lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the
scaffolds is 48Mb. The N50 size of the contigs is 69kb. The total
length of all contigs is 3.12 Gb, and the total length of all
supercontigs is 3.2 Gb.
