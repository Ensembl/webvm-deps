<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>The gene set for Chicken was built using a modified version of the 
standard Ensembl genebuild pipeline. Gene models are based on genewise 
alignments of chicken proteins as well as genetically distant proteins 
from other species. To improve the accuracy of models generated from 
distant species, the Genewise alignments were made to stretches of 
genomic sequence rather than to 'miniseqs'. The protein based gene 
models were then extended using Chicken cDNA and EST alignments, the 
cDNAs were added to models made from chicken proteins and the ESTs to 
models based on proteins from other species. The resulting gene models 
were then assessed by generating sets of potential orthologs to genes 
from other vertebrate species. Potentially missing predictions and 
partial gene predictions were identified by examining the orthologs, 
which were then used to build new gene models.</p>
