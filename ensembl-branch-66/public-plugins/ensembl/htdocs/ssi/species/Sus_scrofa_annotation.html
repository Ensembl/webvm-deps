<h3>Annotation</h3>
<p>
The Pig Sscrofa9 was annotated using a standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline. Predictions 
from vertebrates as well as pig proteins have been used to create the gene set, along with 
human 1:1 orthologs aligned to the pig genome using Exonerate.  Pig cDNAs have been used 
to add UTRs to pig protein based predictions, and pig ESTs were used to add UTR to predictions 
made from non-pig proteins.
