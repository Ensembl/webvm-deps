<h3 style="clear:both">Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">The Ensembl human gene annotations have been updated using Ensembl's automatic annotation pipeline.
The updated annotation incorporates new protein and cDNA sequences which have become publicly available since the last GRCh37 genebuild (March 2009).</p>

<p class="space-below">
In release 66 (February 2012), we continue to display a joint gene set based
on the merge between the automatic annotation from Ensembl and the manually
curated annotation from Havana. This refined gene set corresponds to <A HREF=http://www.gencodegenes.org/>GENCODE</A> release 11.
The Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) identifiers have also been mapped to the annotations.
More information about the <A HREF=/info/docs/genebuild/ccds.html>CCDS project</A>.

Updated manual annotation from Havana is merged into the Ensembl annotation
every release. Transcripts from the two annotation sources are merged if they
share the same internal exon-intron boundaries (i.e. have identical splicing
pattern) with slight differences in the terminal exons allowed. Importantly,
all Havana transcripts are included in the final Ensembl/Havana merged
(GENCODE) gene set. In this release, 23171 Ensembl gene models and 45484
Havana genes were merged together to create the final set of 56478 genes.
