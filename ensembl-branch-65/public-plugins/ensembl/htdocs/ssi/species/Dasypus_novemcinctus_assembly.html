<p class="space-below">This is the first release of the low-coverage 2X assembly 
of the nine-banded armadillo (<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>). The genome sequencing 
and assembly are provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 46 
kb and is 2.7 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in supercontigs 
is 3.85 Gb and in contigs is 2.15 Gb.</p>
