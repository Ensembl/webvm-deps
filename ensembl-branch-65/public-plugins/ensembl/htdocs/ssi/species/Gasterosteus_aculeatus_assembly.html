<p class="space-below">This is the first release of the Stickleback genome (<i>Gasterosteus 
aculeatus</i>). The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by the  
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Broad Institute</a>,  with 
cDNAs and ESTs being provided by the <a href="http://www-shgc.stanford.edu/resources/stickleback.html">Stanford Human Genome Center</a>.
The assembly has been sequenced by whole-genome shotgun 
sequencing with a base coverage of approximately 11x. The stickleback 
genome is approximately 460 Mb in length and comprises 22 pairs of 
chromosomes (groups) including a mitochondrial chromosome and an 
additional 1,822 unplaced supercontigs.
