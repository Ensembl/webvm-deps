<h3>Assembly and Annotation</h3>

<img src="/img/species/pic_Drosophila_melanogaster.png" style="width:80px;height:80px" alt="drosophila melanogaster" class="float-left" />
<p class="space-below">The data displayed on the Ensembl Fruitfly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> site is a compendium of data from different sources, including <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/">BDGP</a>, <a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> and <a href="http://www.dhgp.org/">DHGP</a>.
The genomic sequence is based on <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/sequence/release5genomic.shtml">BDGP assembly release 5</a> (April 2006), and annotations
displayed in Ensembl Fruitfly are imported from <a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> release 5.25 (FB2010_02, dated 19 February 2010). No additional gene build has been carried out, however blast hits and protein features have been computed through the Ensembl Fruitfly pipeline.</p>

<p class="space-below">We have included Drosophila into the Ensembl Fruitfly to allow people to access the Fly genome through the Ensembl user interface (both for visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration through our comparative genomics resources (such as homologous gene links and family pages).</p>

<p>The canonical data for Drosophila is managed at 
<a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> and we are working in partnership 
with them to provide feedback on their resources.</p>

<h3>Variation Data</h3>

<p class="space-below">
The Ensembl Fruitfly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> variation database has been produced using data from <a href="http://www.dpgp.org/1K_50genomes.html#Reference_Release_1.0">release 1.0</a> of the "50 genomes" data set from the <a href="http://www.dpgp.org">Drosophila Population Genome Project</a>. The data set contains over 6.7 million SNPs from two populations, one comprising 37 lines from north Carolina and the other comprising 15 lines from Malawi. The DPGP data has been released in advance of publication and the consortium has requested that users of these data (both Release 0.5 and Release 1.0) defer publication for six (6) months after the appearance of Release 1.0 (see the <a href="http://www.dpgp.org/1K_50genomes.html#Reference_Release_1.0">release notes</a> for more information).
