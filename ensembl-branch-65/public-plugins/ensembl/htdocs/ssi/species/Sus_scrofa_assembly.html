This is the first release of the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_scrofa/">high-coverage Sscrofa9 (April 2009) assembly</a> 
for chromosomes 1 to 18 and X of the pig genome,  <i>Sus scrofa</i>.  Using the 
integrated highly contiguous physical map of the pig genome 
(Humphray et al, Genome Biology 2007,8:R139) as a template for sequencing, the  
<a href="http://www.piggenome.org/">International Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium</a>
has secured <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Info/Press/2006/060116.shtml">first phase funding</a> 
from the USDA to achieve a draft 4x sequence depth across the genome through a minimal tilepath
BAC by BAC approach.  The map is localised to the genome through the
integration of the UIUC RH markers, the tilepath is being selected from the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_scrofa/library_details.shtml#CHORI242">CH-242 library</a> 
generated from a single Duroc sow.</a>
