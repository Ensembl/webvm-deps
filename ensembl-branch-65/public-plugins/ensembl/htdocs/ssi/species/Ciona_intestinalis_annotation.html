<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p>The standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline was modified for annotation of 
the <i>Ciona</i> genome, owing to the lack of genomic information from 
closely related species. Thus, in addition to aligning known <i>Ciona</i> 
proteins to the sequence (as per the standard pipeline), we aligned the 
large quantities of Ciona-specific cDNA and EST sequences against the genome, 
and then used protein data from other species to build additional gene models.</p>
