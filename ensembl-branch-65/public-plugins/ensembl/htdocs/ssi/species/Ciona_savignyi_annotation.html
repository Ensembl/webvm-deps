<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p>The standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline was modified for annotation of 
the <i>Ciona savignyi</i> genome, owing to the lack of genomic information from 
closely-related species. Thus, in addition to aligning known Ciona 
proteins to the sequence (as per the standard pipeline), we aligned 
Ciona-specific cDNA and EST sequences against the genome, and then used 
these in conjunction with protein data from other species to build 
additional gene models.</p>
