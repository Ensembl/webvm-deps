<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>Annotation of the AgamP3 assembly was carried out by VectorBase. The  
set of gene models presented (genebuild 4, released June 2007)  
combines manual annotation of chromosome arm 2L, data provided by the  
research community, and gene prediction using the Ensembl system.   
Prediction utilised alignments of dipteran and other protein sets to  
the genome and generation of GeneWise models, alignment and gene  
prediction based on Anopheles ESTs, and selected ab initio  
predictions. 'Known' genes are those which could be named using  
entries from the <a href="http://may2005.archive.ensembl.org/Anopheles_gambiae/submission">community gene symbol database</a> or from UniProt.

<h3>New Identifiers</h3>

<p>From genebuild 4, VectorBase stable identifiers for genes,
transcripts and proteins are used instead of Ensembl-style
identifiers.  All VB identifiers for Anopheles gambiae begin with the
4 letters AGAP.  The same numeric value is used for a gene and all
its products.  Alternative products of a single gene have suffixes
ending A, B, C etc.</p>

<p>Ensembl-style identifiers in the previous genebuild have been mapped
where possible to the new identifiers.  The web browser page
IDHistoryView summarises relationships between old and new
identifiers.  This page can be reached by clicking the 'ID history'
link at the left of each gene view page or from the search results
for an unmapped old-style identifier. <!--You can also use
<a href="/Anopheles_gambiae/historyview">HistoryView</a> to enter
a list of old-style identifiers and return a list of current
equivalents.--></p>

<p>Example:  Gene CPR34 has the VB identifier AGAP006864, with
transcript AGAP006864-RA and protein AGAP006864-PA.  The
corresponding old identifiers were gene ENSANGG00000020866,
transcript ENSANGT00000023320 and protein ENSANGP00000024283.</p>
