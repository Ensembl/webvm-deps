<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">Genes were annotated by <a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr">Genoscope</a>,
combining evidence from Geneid, Genscan, Genewise and Exofish predictions 
with alignments of Tetraodon cDNAs to the genome. This was done automatically using GAZE 
(Howe K., Chothia T. and Durbin R. 2002. Gen. Res. 12, 1418-27) with a
custom-designed configuration and gene structure model.</p>

<p>The annotation also includes 87 manually curated structures of a number of 
HOX and Cytokine genes.</p>
