<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p class="space-below"> ailMel1 (GCA_000004335.1) is an assembly of the giant panda,
sequenced using a three-year-old female panda at China's Chengdu
breeding center. The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by
the <a href="http://english.big.cas.cn/">Bejing Genomics Institute</a> (BGI).
</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome
lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the
scaffolds is 1.3Mb. The total length of all scaffolds is 2.3Gb, for
a genome size estimated to be 2.4Gb.</p>
