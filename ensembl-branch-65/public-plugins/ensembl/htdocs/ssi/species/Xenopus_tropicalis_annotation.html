<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p>The gene set was built using the Ensembl pipeline. 19249 cDNAs were used 
to add the untranslated regions (UTRs). 31465 <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> 
proteins were used to predict the transcript structures. Finally, gene 
predictions based on UniProt vertebrate proteins were used to fill gaps 
in the annotation. The gene set contains 18429 protein coding genes, 121 
pseudogenes, 52 retrotransposed genes and 1552 non coding RNA.</p>
