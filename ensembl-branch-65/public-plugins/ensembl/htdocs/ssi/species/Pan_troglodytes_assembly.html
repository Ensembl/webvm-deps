This site displays version 2.1.4 (February 2011) of the chimpanzee genome assembly (known as Pan_troglodytes-2.1.4 or CHIMP2.1.4).The whole 
genome shotgun sequence data were assembled and organized by the Washington University Genome Center.The underlying whole 
genome shotgun data were generated at the Washington University School of Medicine and the Broad Institute.</p>
   
<p class="space-below">This assembly, version 2.1.4, has an updated chromosome Y compared to version
2.1.3. Assembly 2.1.3 represented an improvement on the 2.1 chimp assembly by
adding in over 300,000 finishing reads, and merging in 640 finished BACS. There
were approximately 49,000 additional merges made in that assembly as compared to
the 2.1 assembly.</p>
 
<p class="space-below">This assembly covers about 97 percent of the genome and is based on 6X sequence
coverage. It is composed of 185,384 contigs with an N50 length of 53kb, and 33,990 supercontigs 
with an N50 length of 9Mb.</p>

<p>The whole genome shotgun data from primary donor-derived reads (Clint, a
captive-born male chimpanzee from the Yerkes Primate Research Center (Atlanta,USA)) 
were assembled using PCAP (Huang 2006) using stringent parameters derived
by eliminating detectable global mis-assemblies (interchromosomalcross-overs
determined by alignment of the chimpanzee genome against the human genome)
larger than 50kb.</p>
