<p class="space-below">The Ensembl human gene annotations have been updated using Ensembl's automatic annotation pipeline. The updated annotation incorporates new protein and cDNA sequences which have become publicly available since the last GRCh37 genebuild (March 2009).</p>

<p class="space-below">
In release 65 (December 2011), we continue to display a joint
gene set based on the merge between the automatic annotation
from Ensembl and the manually curated annotation from Havana.
This refined gene set corresponds to 
<a href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/">GENCODE</a> release 10. The Consensus
Coding Sequence (CCDS) identifiers have also been mapped to the
annotations. <a href="/info/docs/genebuild/ccds.html">More information about the CCDS project</a>
</p>

<p class="space-below">Updated manual annotation from Havana is merged into the Ensembl annotation every release. Transcripts from the two annotation sources are merged if they share the same internal exon-intron boundaries (i.e. have identical splicing pattern) with slight differences in the terminal exons allowed. Importantly, all Havana transcripts are included in the final Ensembl/Havana merged (GENCODE) gene set.
