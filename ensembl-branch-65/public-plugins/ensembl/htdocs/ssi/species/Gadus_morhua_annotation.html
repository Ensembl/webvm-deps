<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">
Owing to the fragmentary nature of the Atlantic cod assembly, it was 
necessary to combine the standard protein-evidence based annotation 
approach with a complementary annotation method based on a 

<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/2x_genomes.html">whole genome alignment</a> 
to stickleback. Some scaffolds were rearranged into "gene-scaffold" 
super-structures using our projection method, and 17,920 out of 20,787 
protein-coding stickleback genes were mapped onto reorganized scaffolds. 
In addition, protein-coding genes, pseudogenes and non-coding RNAs were 
annotated using the standard protein evidenced based Ensembl pipeline. 
These approaches resulted in a final gene set of 20,095 protein-coding 
genes, 518 pseudogenes, and 1,541 noncoding RNA genes.
