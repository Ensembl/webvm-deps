This is the first release of the low-coverage 1.90X assembly of the
thirteen-lined ground squirrel (<i>Spermophilus tridecemlineatus </i>). The genome sequencing
and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs
is 53.23 kb and is 2.75 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in
supercontigs is 3.42 Gb and in contigs is 1.91 Gb.
