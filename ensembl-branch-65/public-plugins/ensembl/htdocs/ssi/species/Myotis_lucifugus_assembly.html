Myoluc2.0 (GCA_000147115.1) is the latest assembly of the microbat or little brown bat (<em>Myotis lucifugus</em>), 
sequenced to 7X coverage. The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a> as part of the Mammalian 
Genome Project.<p>
<p class="space-below">
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of scaffolds is 4.3Mb.
The total of all scaffolds is 1.96Gb.
