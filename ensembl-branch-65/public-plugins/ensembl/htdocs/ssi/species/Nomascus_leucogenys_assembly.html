<p>The Northern white-cheeked gibbon (<i>Nomascus leucogenys</i>) genome of a 
wild-born female named 'Asia' (international studbook #0098) was sequenced to 5.6x 
whole genome coverage. The sequencing was provided by The Baylor College of 
Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center, and the Genome Center at Washington 
University using Sanger methods. The sequencing method combined whole genome shotgun
plasmid, fosmid and BAC end sequences.</p>

<p>The sequence was assembled at <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT</a> using the
<a href="http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/8/R88">Arachne Assembler and assisted with the Human NCBI36 assembly</a>. This draft sequence assembly 
submitted to Genbank is referred to as Nleu1.0 (GCA_000146795.1).</p>

<p>Funding for the sequencing of the <i>Nomascus leucogenys</i> genome was provided by
the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of
Health (NIH).</p>

<p>The N50 size is the median sequence length, i.e. 50% of the assembled genome
lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the contigs is
35.1 kb. The total length of all contigs is 2.76 Gb. When the gaps between
contigs in scaffolds are included, the total span of the assembly is 
2.88 Gb.</p>
