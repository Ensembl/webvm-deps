The gene set for elephant was built using the Ensembl pipeline.
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of rodent proteins
as well are genetically distant proteins from other species,
including most vertebrate proteins from Uniprot. Additionally,
mouse proteins were aligned using exonerate. Potentially missing
predictions and partial gene predictions were identified by
examining the orthologs, which were then used to build new gene models.
