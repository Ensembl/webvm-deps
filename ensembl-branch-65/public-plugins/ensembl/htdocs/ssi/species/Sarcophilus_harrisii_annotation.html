<h3>Annotation</h3>
<p>
The Ensembl genome annotation pipeline was used to identify genes. Models built from
Tasmanian devil proteins and cDNAs have been given priority over predictions from other
vertebrate species. 5,663 transcript models made from paired end Illumina RNA-Seq were
added into the gene set where they added a novel model or splice variant. RNA-Seq data
was also used to add UTR to non species specific models. The total gene set contains
20,419 genes including pseudogenes and ncRNAs.
