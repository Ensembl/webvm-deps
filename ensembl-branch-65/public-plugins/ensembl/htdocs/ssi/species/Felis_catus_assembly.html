<p class="space-below">This is the second release of the low-coverage 1.87X assembly of the
domestic cat (<i>Felis catus</i>). The genome sequencing was
performed by <a href="http://www.agencourt.com/">Agencourt Bioscience</a>
and assembly provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.</p>

<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs
is 45.22 kb and is 2.38 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in
supercontigs is 3.94 Gb and in contigs is 1.64 Gb.
