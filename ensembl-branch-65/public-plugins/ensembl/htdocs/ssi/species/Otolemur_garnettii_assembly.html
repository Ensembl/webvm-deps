<p>
OtoGar3 is a high coverage assembly for bushbaby (<i>Otolemur garnettii</i>). The combined WGS and BAC-end sequence reads 
were assembled This whole genome shotgun assembly was produced from Illumina short-read sequence data using ALLPATHS-LG 
assembly software developed by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. 
The N50 size of scaffolds is 13.852kb. The total of all scaffolds is 2.519Gb.
