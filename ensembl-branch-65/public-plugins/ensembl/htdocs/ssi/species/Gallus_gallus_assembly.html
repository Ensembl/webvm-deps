<p class="space-below">This site displays the 2.1 (May 2006) release of the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/gallus_gallus/">chicken genome</a>. The analysis of the chicken sequence involves an international group of scientists including individuals from the US, UK, Europe and China, headed by the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis.</p>

<p>Of the 1.05 Gb genome, approximately 95% of the sequence has been anchored to chromosomes, which include autosomes 1-28 and 32, two additional linkage groups, and sex chromosomes W and Z. (In contrast to mammals, the female chicken is heterogametic (ZW) and the male is homogametic (ZZ).) The remaining unanchored contigs have been concatenated into the virtual chromosome "chrUn", separated by gaps of 100 bp. All unknown gap sizes have been set to 100 bp. The N50 ultracontig size is 15.5Mb (n=19); the longest ultracontig is 80.3Mb on chicken chromosome 3. The N50 supercontig size is 11.1Mb (n=26); the longest supercontig is 52Mb on chr2. The N50 contig size is 45kb (n=5863); the longest contig is 625kb. Q20 base redundancy: 7.1X</p>
