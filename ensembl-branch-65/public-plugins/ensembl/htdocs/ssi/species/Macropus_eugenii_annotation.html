<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>Annotation of the genome was completed using the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/docs/2x_genomes.html">low coverage gene-build method</a>. During this process, some scaffolds were used to construct larger "gene-scaffolds". There are 10,257 such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".</p>

<p>The gene set for wallaby contains a total of 17,877 genes, of which 15,290 are protein coding.</p>
