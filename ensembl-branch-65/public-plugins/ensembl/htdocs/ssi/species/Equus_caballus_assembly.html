<p class="space-below">The EquCab2 assembly is a Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assembly at 6.79x. A female thoroughbred named "Twilight" 
was selected as the representative horse for genome sequencing. The project coordination and genome sequencing 
and assembly is provided by the <a href=http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals>Broad Institute</a>.</p>
<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the contigs is 112.38 kb, and the total length of all contigs is 2.43 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are included, the total span of the assembly is 2.68 Gb.
