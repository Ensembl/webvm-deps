<h3>Annotation</h3>
<p>
The gene set for microbat was built using the Ensembl pipeline.
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of microbat proteins,
mammal proteins as well as genetically distance proteins from other
species, including most vertebrate proteins from Uniprot. Additionally,
dog and cow proteins were aligned using exonerate. The protein based
gene models were then extended using microbat and cow cDNA.
In addition to the coding transcript models, non-coding RNAs and
pseudogenes were annotated

<h3>Mammalian Genome Project</h3>
<p>
<i>Myotis lucifugus</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of
the Mammalian Genome Project, funded by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch
length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of
mammalian species. The aim is to increase our understanding of functional
elements, especially in the human genome.
