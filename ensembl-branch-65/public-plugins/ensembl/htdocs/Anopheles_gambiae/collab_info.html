<h3 class="boxed">The International Anopheles Genome Project</h3>
	 
<p>The International Anopheles Genome project began in 1999 and is a collaboration between Celera Genomics, Genoscope, the University of Notre Dame, EBI/Sanger Institute, EMBL, Institut Pasteur, IMBB and TIGR. The project was mainly funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH, USA), the French Ministry of Research, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) to provide the genome sequence of Anopheles gambiae. The US company Celera Genomics and the French national sequencing center (Genoscope) were respectively funded by the NIH and the French Ministry of Research to generate the whole genome shotgun (WGS), which was then assembled by Celera. In a combined effort Celera and Ensembl have produced an initial annotation of the sequence by combining homology searches and ab initio gene prediction methods. This annotation is preliminary and is likely to contain errors, the International Anopheles Sequencing Group is considering how best to validate and further improve this sequence and its annotation.</p>

<p>Ensembl also works closely with other Anopheles information resources such as <a href="http://www.anobase.org" title="AnoBase">AnoBase</a>, <a href="http://www.bio.nd.edu/biology/programs/CTDRT.htm" title="ND">University of Notre Dame</a> and <a href="http://www.malaria.mr4.org" title="MR4">MR4</a>; other anopheles resources can be found on the <a href="/Anopheles_gambiae/resources.html">resource page</a>.</p>

<p>The considerable genetic variation within the PEST strain, and outbred nature of the mosquito causes issues with polymorphic regions disrupting the
assembly; however dispite this the majority of the assembly appears to be well defined. </p>
