<h1>The STAR Project</h1>

<p><img src="/img/star_logo.png" alt="STAR logo" class="float-right" style="margin-right:20px">
The main goal of the STAR project is the creation of a detailed  
haplotype map for the rat.  To address this goal, the STAR project  
consortium conducted sequencing and genotyping of a number of rat  
strains and provide public access to the data through this web page.   
All of the data described here has been integrated into the Ensembl  
databases and is available through the standard Enesmbl web  
interfaces and the Ensembl API.</p>

<p>This page provides the SNPs discovered from a set of approximately  
240,000 sequencing reads and the results of genotyping almost 400 rat  
strains at approximately 21,000 markers.</p>

<p>Data can be downloaded from our FTP server:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://anonymous@ftp.ensembl.org:/pub/release-45/rattus_norvegicus_45_34o/data/star/star_genotypes_seq_070322/STAR_4_STRAIN_SNP">SNPs discovered from sequencing data</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Additional data mining on the set of genotyped SNPs is provided at the 
<a href="http://gscan.well.ox.ac.uk/gsBleadingEdge/rat.snp.selector.cgi">Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics</a> 
at Oxford University.</p>  

<p>The STAR project is a specific targeted research project funded by  
European Union through Framework Programme 6.  Full details regarding  
the STAR project are available at <a href="http://www.snp-star.eu">http://www.snp-star.eu</a>.</p>

<p>All of the data is made freely available before scientific  
publication with the following understanding:</p>

<ol class="spaced">
<li>The data may be freely downloaded, used in analyses, and  
repackaged in databases.</li>
<li>Users are free to use the data in scientific papers analysing  
particular genes and regions if the provider of these data is  
properly acknowledged.  See the STAR consortium website listed above  
for credit and contact information.</li>
<li>The centres producing the data reserve the right to publish the  
initial large-scale analyses of the data set, including large-scale  
identification of regions of evolutionary conservation, haplotype  
structure, and other large-scale genomic analysis. Large-scale refers  
to regions with size on the order of a chromosome (that is, 30 Mb or  
more).</li>
<li>This policy is in accordance with, and with the understandings  
in the Fort Lauderdale meeting discussing 
<a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd003208.html">Community Resource Projects</a>.</li>
<li>Any redistribution of the data should carry this notice.</li>
