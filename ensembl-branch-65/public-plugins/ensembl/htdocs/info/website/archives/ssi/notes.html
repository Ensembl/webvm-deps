<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ensembl aims to maintain stable identifiers for genes (ENSG), 
transcripts (ENST), proteins (ENSP) and exons (ENSE) as long as possible. 
Changes  within the genome sequence assembly or an updated genome 
annotation may dramatically change a gene model. In these cases, the old 
set of stable IDs is retired and a new one assigned. Gene and transcript
pages both have an ID History view which maps changes in the ID
from the earliest version in Ensembl.</li>

<li>Protein family identifiers (fam), Ensembl EST gene identifiers
(ENSESTG) and Genscan identifiers (GENSCAN) are currently not stable.</li>

<li>DAS sources are not archived so any shown are current data.</li>

<li>BLAST and BLAT are not currently available from the archive site.</li>
</ul>
