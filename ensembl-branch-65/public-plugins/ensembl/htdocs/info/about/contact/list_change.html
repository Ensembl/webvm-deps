<h1>Changes to Ensembl Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>
In the near future, we will be changing the way that the ensembl-dev and ensembl-announce mailing lists are managed.
</p>

<p>
The move to new hardware and list managing software will increase responsiveness on the lists (ensembl-dev in particular has suffered from slow deliveries for some time), and in time will also allow us to provide a searchable archive of past posts.
</p>

<p>
The list addresses will change with the move.
</p>

<ul>

  <li>ensembl-dev@ebi.ac.uk becomes <strong>dev@ensembl.org</strong></li>

  <li>ensembl-announce@ebi.ac.uk becomes <strong>announce@ensembl.org</strong></li>
 
</ul>

<p>The new addresses are active now.</p>

<p>All subscribers to the old lists have been moved to the new lists. Posts to the old list addresses will be automatically forwarded for a short time, but please update your email address books and any spam filters to reflect the new address list.</p>

<p>Information about the new lists, including details on how to subscribe and unsubscribe, can be found at <a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo">http://lists.ensembl.org/</a>.</p>

<p>As before, dev@ensembl.org is an open list which any subscriber can post to. Posting to announce@ensembl.org is restricted to Ensembl people.</p>
