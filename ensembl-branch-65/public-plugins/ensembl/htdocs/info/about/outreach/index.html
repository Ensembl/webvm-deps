<h1>Outreach</h1>

<p>
The Outreach team is the main contact point for Ensembl users. They
answer questions sent via
<a href="/Help/Contact" class="popup">email</a>, make sure that
problems spotted by users are  fixed by liaising with the other
Ensembl teams, and give workshops, demos and presentations on the  use
of Ensembl worldwide. An example of a typical browser workshop is
given below.
</p>

<p>
In addition the Outreach team regularly organises workshops on the use
of the Ensembl  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These
workshops normally are 2 or 3 days. If you  are interested in hosting
a workshop or want more information, please contact 
<a href="mailto:gspudich@ebi.ac.uk">Giulietta Spudich</a>.

</p>

<p>
For academic institutions our courses are free of charge. However we
request that travel, accommodation  and subsistence costs of the
instructor(s) are reimbursed by the host.
</p>

<p>To find out about our current workshop schedule, please see our
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/calendar/eventscalendar.php?events_subcategory_id=22&amp;md2=1">training calendar</a> or look out for the <a href="http://www.ensembl.info/workshops/calendar/">announcements on our blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Working with Developers</h2>

<p>
Whilst our browser and API workshops are ideal for researchers who
make occasional use of our data,  we can also provide help for users
who wish to set up their own Ensembl installation, customise  an
Ensembl-based site and develop their own display pages.
</p>

<p>
A developer workshop is held approximately
once a year, and of course  there is
our <a href="/info/about/contact/mailing.html">developers' mailing
list</a> where you can  post questions to the whole Ensembl team.
</p>

<p>
For a more immersive experience, the
"<a href="/info/about/outreach/geek4aweek.html">Geek for a Week</a>"
scheme allows developers and researchers to work alongside Ensembl
team members for a short intensive  collaborative project.
</p>


<h2>Browser workshop</h2>

<p>
Our standard 1-day browser workshop offers participants the
possibility of gaining lots of  hands-on experience in the use of the
Ensembl genome browser, but also provides them with the  necessary
background information. The workshop is primarily targeted at wetlab
researchers.
</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>
The workshop consists of a series of modules, listed below. Most
modules consist of a presentation,  followed by the opportunity to do
exercises. Participants are encouraged to bring problems/questions
about their research and we will try to tackle these during the
workshop using Ensembl. The exact mix  of modules can be varied,
depending on the preferences of the participants.
</p>

<ul>

<li>Introduction to Ensembl: origin, goals and organization of the
Ensembl project</li>

<li>Worked example: guided tour of the most important pages of the
Ensembl website</li>

<li>Data mining with BioMart: retrieving datasets using the data
mining tool BioMart</li>

<li>Genebuild: how are Ensembl gene and transcripts predictions
made?</li>

<li>Comparative genomics and proteomics: orthologues, protein
families, whole genome alignments  and syntenic regions</li>

<li>Variations: SNPs, haplotypes, linkage disquilibrium</li>

<li>Other: functional genomics, DAS</li>

</ul>

<p>
A typical one-day workshop will consist of the first four of these
modules, plus one other module of your choice; alternatively we can
run a two-day workshop covering a wider range of topics.
</p>

<p>
The only prerequisite for the browser workshop is general knowledge of
molecular biology / genomics and  a familiarity with web browsers.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>

<li>Computer room with a PC (or Mac) for each participant - 30 is the
maximum number of participants</li>

<li>Each computer should have a (reasonably fast) internet connection
and an internet browser installed  (preferably FireFox, although
Internet Explorer will also work)</li>

<li>A computer for the instructor, connected to a projector, with an
internet connection and MS PowerPoint installed</li>

</ul>

<h3>Certificates</h3>

<p>
We don't usually make and give out certificates of attendance to
participants; however if the host wishes to do this, this is fine by
us and we will be happy to sign them!
