<h1>Mirror sites</h1>

<p>In order to improve our service to users around the world, we are gradually introducing mirror sites in key locations.</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;margin-top:2em">Current mirrors</h2>

<h3>California</h3>

<img src="/img/flag_usa.png" alt="flag" style="float:left;padding-right:10px" />
<p>Our second and newest mirror is hosted in San Francisco, California. It went live in July 2009.</p>

<p>Please note that this mirror site is intended primarily for users on the <strong>West Coast</strong> of the 
United States, where high latency is caused by the additional hops across the USA. Users on the East Coast
may find that the main site, www.ensembl.org, is faster owing to the high-speed transatlantic link.</p>

<h3>China</h3>

<a href="http://ensembl.genomics.org.cn/"><img src="/img/flag_prc.png" alt="flag" style="float:left;padding-right:10px" /></a>
<p>Our first mirror, hosted by the Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen (BGI-SZ), went live in February 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Outside China, access to this site is very slow</strong>.</p>
