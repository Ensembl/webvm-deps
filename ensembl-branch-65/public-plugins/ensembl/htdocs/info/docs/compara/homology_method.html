<h1>Gene Orthology/Paralogy prediction method</h1>

<h2>Gene Trees</h2>

<p>
The gene orthology and paralogy predictions are generated by a pipeline
where maximum likelihood phylogenetic gene trees (generated by TreeBeST)
play a central role. They aim to represent the evolutionary history of
gene families, i.e. genes that diverged from a common ancestor. These
gene trees reconciled with their species tree have their internal nodes
annotated to distinguish duplication or speciation events.
</p>

<p>
This methodology was published in
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19029536">EnsemblCompara GeneTrees: Analysis of complete, duplication aware phylogenetic trees in vertebrates.
Vilella AJ, Severin J, Ureta-Vidal A, Durbin R, Heng L, Birney E. Genome Research 2008 Nov 4</a>. Please cite this
publication if you use the homologies from Ensembl.
</p>

<p>
There is a clear concordance with reciprocal best approaches in the
simple case of unique orthologous genes. However, the gene tree
pipeline is able to find more complex one-to-many and many-to-many
relations. This, for instance, significantly raises the number of Teleost
(bony fish) to Mammal orthologs and has even more dramatic effects on
Fly/Mammal or Worm/Mammal orthologous gene predictions. Using this
approach, we are also able to "time" duplication events which produce
paralogs by
identifying the most recent common ancestor (=taxonomy level) for a
given
internal node of the tree.
</p>



<p>The gene orthology and paralogy prediction pipeline has 6 basic steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load the longest translation of each gene from all species used in
Ensembl</li>


<li>run WUBlastp+SmithWaterman of every gene against every other (both
self and non-self species) in a genome-wise manner</li>


<li>Build a sparse graph of gene relations based on Blast scores and generate clusters using hcluster_sg<a href="#fn1" class="fn-link"><sup>1</sup></a></li>


<li>For each cluster, build a multiple alignment based on the
protein sequences using a combination of multiple aligners, consensified by M-Coffee<a href="#fn2" class="fn-link"><sup>2</sup></a></li>


<li>For each aligned cluster, build a phylogenetic tree using
TreeBeST<a href="#fn3" class="fn-link"><sup>3</sup></a> using the CDS back-translation of the protein multiple alignment 
from the original DNA sequences<sup>**</sup>. A rooted tree with internal duplication tags is 
obtained at this stage, reconciling it with the species tree in
<kbd>ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/species_tree_njtree.taxon_id.nh</kbd> (refer to section "Create the species tree file" in <kbd>ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/README-genetree</kbd> for a more detailed explanation).</li>


<li>From each gene tree, infer gene pairwise relations of orthology<sup>*</sup> and
paralogy types.</li>
</ol>

<p>* There is an extra optional step which calculates the dN/dS values for the
orthology relationships of closely related pairs of species. We use codeml in the 
PAML<a href="#fn4" class="fn-link"><sup>4</sup></a> package (model=0, NSsites=0) for this (ensembl-compara/scripts/homology/codeml.ctl.hash). </p>

<p>We only calculate these dN/dS values for high-coverage closely-related pairs of
species. When the species evolutionary distance is too large, the
saturation of the dS values biases the estimated dN/dS
ratio. When the dS value of a given ortholog gene pair is too large, we mask out the dN/dS ratio, 
although the N, S, dN, dS and log-likelihood (lnL) values can still be obtained for all pairs.</p>

<!-- <p>For the (sub)trees that have all dS branches shorter than 1.8, we -->
<!-- also calculate sitewise dN/dS values for every (sub)alignment using -->
<!-- SLR<a href="#fn6" class="fn-link">6</a>.</p> -->

<p>** A description of the tree building method in TreeBeST: the CDS
back-translated protein alignment (i.e., codon alignment) is used to
build 5 different trees:</p>
<ol class="lc-roman">
<li>a maximum likelihood (ML) tree built using phyml, based on the protein alignment with the WAG model;</li>
<li>a ML tree built using phyml, based on the codon alignment with the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model;</li> 
<li>a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree using p-distance, based on the codon alignment;</li>
<li>a NJ tree using dN distance, based on the codon alignment; and</li>
<li>a NJ tree using dS distance, based on the codon alignment.</li>
</ol>

<p>For (1) and (2), TreeBeST uses a modified version of phyml release
2.4.5 which takes an input
species tree, and tries to build a gene tree that is consistent with
the topology of the species tree. This "species-guided" phyml uses the
original phyml tree-search code. However, the objective function
maximised during the tree-search is multiplied by an extra likelihood
factor not found in the original phyml. This extra likelihood factor
reflects the number of duplications and losses inferred in a gene
tree, given the topology of the species tree. The species-guided phyml
allows the gene tree to have a topology that is inconsistent with the
species tree if the alignment strongly supports this. The species tree
is based on the NCBI taxonomy tree (subject to some modifications
depending on new datasets).</p>

<p>The final tree is made by merging the five trees into one consensus
tree using the "tree merging" algorithm. This allows TreeBeST to
take advantage of the fact that DNA-based trees often are more
accurate for closely related parts of trees and protein-based trees
for distant relationships, and that a group of algorithms may
outperform others under certain scenarios. The algorithm
simultaneously merges the five input trees into a consensus tree. The
consensus topology contains clades found in any of the input trees,
where the clades chosen are those that minimize the number of
duplications and losses inferred, and have the highest bootstrap
support. Branch lengths are estimated for the final consensus tree
based on the DNA alignment, using phyml with the HKY model.</p>

<p>A <b>stable ID</b> is assigned to each GeneTree. Please refer to the <a href="stable_ids.html">Family and GeneTree stable ID page</a> for more info.</p>

<h2>Homology types</h2>
<p>Using the Gene Trees, we can infer the following pairwise relationships.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Orthologues</dt>
<dd><p>any gene pairwise relation where the ancestor node is a
speciation event. We predict several descriptions of orthologues:</p>
<ul>
<li>ortholog_one2one</li>
<li>ortholog_one2many</li>
<li>ortholog_many2many</li>
<li>apparent_ortholog_one2one</li>
<li>possible_ortholog</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Paralogues</dt>
<dd><p>any gene pairwise relation where the ancestor node is a duplication event. We predict several descriptions of paralogues:</p>

<ul>
<li>within_species_paralog</li>
<li>between_species_paralog (only as exceptions, see below)</li>
<li>other_paralog</li>
<li>contiguous_gene_split</li>
<li>putative_gene_split</li>
</ul>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Genes in different species and related by a speciation event are defined as
<b>orthologs</b>. Depending on the number of genes found in each species, we
differentiate among 1:1, 1:many and many:many relationships. Please, refer to the
figure where there are examples of the three kinds.
</p>

<p>
A <b>within_species_paralog</b> corresponds to a relation between 2
genes of the same species where the ancestor node
has been labelled as a duplication node. In the previous figure,
Hsap2 and Hsap2', and Mmus2 and Mmus2' are two examples of within-species-paralogs.
The duplication event relating the paralogues does not need to affect this species only.
For example, Mmus2' and Mmus3' are
also within_species_paralog but the duplication event has occurred
in the common ancestor between species Hsap (human) and species Mmus (mouse).
The taxonomy level "times" the duplication
event to the ancestor of "Euarchontoglires".
</p>

<p>
When paralogous genes are too distant to be in the same gene tree, but can still be related as part of a 
broader "super-family", they are labelled as <b>other_paralog</b> relationships. In this case, the precise taxonomic 
level of the duplication event is left as undetermined.
</p>

<p>
A <b>between_species_paralog</b> corresponds to a relation between genes of different species where the ancestor node
has been labelled as a duplication node e.g. Mmus1:Hsap2 or Mmus1:Hsap3.
Currently, we do not annotate between_species_paralog, except in the following cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>When the between_species_paralog can be characterised as 1:1 relationships, that is when the duplication node
related one single gene from each species. These are relabelled as <b>apparent_ortholog_one2one</b>.
They can be the results of real duplications followed
by gene losses (as shown in the picture below), but most of the times occur as the result
of a wrong gene tree topology with a spurious duplication node. Often times, assembly errors
are behind these problems.</li>
<li>
When the duplication node is weakly-supported (species-intersection-score &le; 0.25), they will be stored
in the database as <b>possible_orthologs</b>. As the name suggests, it is not clear whether these genes
are real orthologs or not. If no better ortholog is found for a given gene, the possible orthologs are
the next best candidates.</li>
</ul>

<p>A paralog labelled as a <b>gene_split</b> is an artefactual type of paralogy. It is commonly
realted to fragmented genome assemblies or a gene prediction that is
poor in supporting evidences (cDNA, ESTs, proteins, etc.). A
<b>putative_gene_split</b> is called when there is no (or little) overlap between the
gene fragments in the same species and they lie in different sequence
regions in the assembly (see GeneB1/GeneB2 in the image below). 
In contrast, a <b>contiguous_gene_split</b> is called when the
two fragments lie close to each other (&lt;1MB) in the same sequence
region and the same strand (see GeneA1/GeneA2 below).

<li id="fn1"><a href="http://treesoft.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/treesoft/branches/lh3/hcluster/">Hcluster_sg</a>
: hierarchical clustering software for sparse graphs. hcluster_sg performs hierarchical clustering under mean distance. It reads an input file that describes the similarity between two sequences, and groups two nearest nodes at each step. When two nodes are joined, the distance between the joined node and all the other nodes are updated by mean distance. This procedure is iterated until one of the three rules is met: (a) Do not merge cluster A and B if the total number of edges between A and B is smaller than |A|*|B|/3, where |A| and |B| are the sizes of A and B, respectively. This rule guarantees each cluster is compact. (B) Do not join A to any other cluster if |A| &lt; 500. This rule avoids huge clusters which may cause computational burden for multialignment and tree building as well. (C) Do not join A and B if both A and B contain plant genes or both A and B contain Fungi genes. This rule tries to find animal gene families. TreeFam clustering is done with outgroups. Hcluster_sg also introduces an additional edge breaking rule: removes an edge between cluster A and B if the number of edges between A and B is smaller than |A|*|B|/10. This heuristic rule removes weak relations which are quite unlikely to be joined at a later step.
