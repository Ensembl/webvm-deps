<h1>Creating Static Content for Ensembl</h1>

<p>The static documentation for Ensembl is maintained by a number of teams spread across
the Sanger Institute and the EBI. To help ensure that these pages are a) consistent in appearance,
b) easy to navigate and c) play nicely with the rest of the webcode, it is essential
for contributors to follow our guidelines for content creation.</p>
