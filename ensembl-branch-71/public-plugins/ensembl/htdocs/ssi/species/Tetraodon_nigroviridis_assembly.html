<p>The Tetraodon genome project is a collaboration between 
<a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr">Genoscope</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu"> Broad Institute</a> (MIT). This Ensembl website presents 
sequence data and analyses provided by the two institutes.</p>

<p>The project was supported by the Consortium National de Recherche en 
Genomique and the National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>

<p>The genome assembly was performed using <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/wga">Arachne</a> 
(Jaffe D.B. et. al. 2003. Gen. Res. 13, 91-96). This site presents version 7 of the assembly.</p>
