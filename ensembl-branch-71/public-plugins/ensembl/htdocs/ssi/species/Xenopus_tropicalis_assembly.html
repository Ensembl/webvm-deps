<p>The <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> genome assembly version 4.2 
(GCA_000004195.1, November 2009] is the fifth in a series of preliminary assembly releases by the 
JGI that are planned as part of the ongoing <i>X. tropicalis</i> genome project. 
This Ensembl website presents the sequence data provided by the JGI.</p>
         
<p>The reads were assembled using JAZZ, the JGI assembler, producing a 
genome of approximately 1.51 Gb in scaffolds and 1.36Gb in contigs. The 
assembly contains 19,549 scaffolds with an average coverage of 7.65X. 
The N50 length for scaffolds is 1.57 Mb and is 17.04 kb for contigs. The 
N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer.</p>
