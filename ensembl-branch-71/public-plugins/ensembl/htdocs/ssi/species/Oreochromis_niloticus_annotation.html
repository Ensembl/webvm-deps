The gene set was built using a mixed approach. First the Ensembl pipeline was used to generate 195657 models
from orthologous vertebrate proteins from UniprotKB with a protein existence level of 1 or 2. Then, due to
the lack of species specific sequences and the availability of RNA-Seq for tilapia, we used 700M paired-end
reads sequenced by the Broad Institute. The RNA-Seq data contains 11 tissue types: blood, brain, embryo, eye,
heart, kidney, liver, muscle, ovary, skin and testis. We pooled the tissues to avoid creating too many fragmented
models. Using the RNA-Seq pipeline, we created 40899 models from the pooled set. By combining the orthologous
set, the RNA-Seq set and our ncRNA pipeline we built the final gene set: 21437 protein coding gene models, 22
pseudogenes, 3 retrotransposed and 821 non coding RNA.

In addition to the main set, we have predicted gene models for each tissue type using the RNA-Seq pipeline. We
did a BLASTp of these models against <a href="http://www.uniprot.org" target="_blank">UniProt</a> proteins of protein existence level 1 and 2 in
order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF). The best BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting evidence.
