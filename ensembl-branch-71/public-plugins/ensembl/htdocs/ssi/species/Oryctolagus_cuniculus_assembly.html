<p>
Of the 2.74 Gb genome, approximately 82% has been anchored to 
chromosomes, which include autosomes 1-21 and sex chromosome X. 
The remaining unanchored contigs have been concatenated into 
virtual chromosomes "Un".The N50 size is the length such that 50% 
of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. 
The N50 length for supercontigs is 35348.54kb and is 64.65kb for 
contigs. The total number of bases in supercontigs is 2.66 Gb 
and in contigs is 2.60 Gb.
