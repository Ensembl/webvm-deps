<p>The Rat Rnor_5.0 assembly was annotated using the standard Ensembl 
gene annotation system. To improve the gene set, we have incorporated 
new data resources which have become available since the last RGSC 3.4 
genebuild (December 2004), including an updated rat-specific repeat 
library, additional RefSeq and UniProt protein sequence data for predicting 
the coding regions of protein-coding genes, as well as new cDNAs for 
annotating untranslated regions (UTRs) of protein-coding genes.</p>
