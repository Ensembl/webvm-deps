<p> 
Gene annotation in cow has been generated by alignment of proteins from 
three major sources (in descending order of their contribution to the final gene set):

<ul>
<li> <i>Bos taurus</i> (cow) proteins from UniProtKB and NCBI RefSeq and <i>Bos taurus</i> cDNAs from INSDC.
     For proteins, UniProtKB proteins were filtered to keep only those of protein existence (PE) levels 1 and 2 (i.e. with protein or transcript level 
     evidence), and only curated RefSeq proteins (accessions starting with "NP_") were used. 
     For cDNAs, they were also filtered to keep curated RefSeq mRNAs (accessions starting with "NM_") and to remove those associated with PE level 
     3-5 UniProt proteins.</li> 
<li> UniProt mammalian and vertebrate proteins of PE levels 1 and 2; and</li>
<li> Translations of Ensembl human genes which have one-to-one orthologues in mouse (taken from Ensembl release 62 data).</li>
</ul>

The alignment of UniProt and RefSeq proteins were aligned to the cow genome followed procedures in the 
<a href ="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/genome_annotation.html">standard Ensembl genebuild pipeline</a> using Genewise.  
Ensembl human translations were aligned to the cow genome using Exonerate. 

The gene-building procedure on the UMD3.1 assembly identified 19981 protein coding genes and 797 pseudogenes.
