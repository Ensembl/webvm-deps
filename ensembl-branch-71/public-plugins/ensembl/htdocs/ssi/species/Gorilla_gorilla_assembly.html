This is the third release of the draft assembly of the Western lowland gorilla 
(<i>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</i>). The DNA sample came from a 30-year-old female, 
Kamilah, owned by the San Diego Wild Animal Park, 
and sequencing and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>Sequencing was undertaken using two separate methods: traditional
capillary whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing and Solexa
new-technology sequencing. Results from the two methods were used in
the first, second and third draft gorilla assemblies.</p>

<p>The first draft assembly (gorGor1) was released in September 2008. This
initial draft assembly was a 2.1x coverage assembly. It was created from
WGS capillary reads using the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/production/phusion/">Phusion assembler</a>,
with these capillary reads' sequencing errors being corrected by taking the 
consensus of Solexa data aligned to it.</p>

<p>To create the second draft assemby, Solexa data, sequenced at roughly 35x,
was assembled into contigs using 
<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/6/1117.full">Abyss</a>.
The resulting contigs of length 50bp or longer were then assembled along with the WGS
capillary data using the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/production/phusion/">Phusion assembler</a>. Next, the Solexa read pairs
were aligned to the human reference genome using
<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/11/1851.full">Maq</a> to identify 
syntenic regions and breakpoints between human and gorilla. Using human-gorilla 
synteny as a guide, longer gorilla supercontigs were constructed using
<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/5/821.full">Velvet</a> and other
assembly tools.</p>

<p>In the third draft assembly (gorGor3) for the current release, gorilla
supercontigs which could be ordered with respect to the human reference
genome were assembled into simulated chromosomes, while incorporating
the chromosome 2 split (as in chimpanzee) and the reciprocal
translocation between chromosomes 5 and 17.</p>
 
<p>The total length of the gorGor3 assembly is 3.04Gb. The N50 size for
contigs is 11657 bp and the N50 size for supercontigs is 913458 bp.</p>
