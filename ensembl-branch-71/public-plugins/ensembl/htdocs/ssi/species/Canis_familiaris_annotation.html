<p>
CanFam3.1 was annotated using a standard Ensembl mammalian genebuild pipeline, incorporating RNA-Seq data provided by the Broad Institute. 
The annotation process is described in the document below.

<h3>RNASeq data set</h3>

<p>
In addition to the main set, we have predicted gene models for each tissue type using the RNA-Seq pipeline. 
We did a BLASTp of these models against UniProt proteins of protein existence level 1 and 2 in order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF). 
The best BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting evidence. 8,968 gene models were made exclusively from RNASeq data. 
The data was also used to add UTR to gene models.
