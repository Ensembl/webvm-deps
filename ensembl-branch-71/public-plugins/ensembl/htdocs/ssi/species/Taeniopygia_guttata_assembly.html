<p>
This is the first release of the high-coverage ~6X assembly of the Zebra 
finch (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) genome. The sequencing and assembly of the 
genome was done by the 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu">Washington University Genome Sequencing Center</a>.
</p>

<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer. In the initial assembly, prior to the 
inclusion of 35 finished BAC clones in the final assembly, the 92,299 
major contigs had an N50 length of 39kb and the 37,252 major 
supercontigs an N50 length of 10.4Mb.
</p>

<p>
Zebra finch has a genome of 1.2Gb in length, of which 1Gb of sequence 
has been ordered and orientated on the chromosomes and one linkage 
group, with a further 36Mb being localised to specific chromosomes or 
linkage groups.
