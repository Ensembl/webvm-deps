<p>Gallus_gallus-4.0 was annotated using a standard Ensembl genebuild  
pipeline, incorporating RNASeq data provided by a number of sources. The  
annotation process is described in the document below.</p>

<h3>RNASeq data set</h3>

<p>In addition to the main set, we have predicted gene models for each  
tissue type using the RNA-Seq pipeline. We did a BLASTp of these models  
against UniProt proteins of vertabrate species with protein existence  
level 1 and 2 in order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF). The best  
BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting evidence. 5139 gene  
models were made exclusively from RNASeq data. The data was also used to  
add UTR to gene models.</p>

<p>The tissue-specific sets of transcript models built using our RNAseq  
pipeline are as follows:</p>
