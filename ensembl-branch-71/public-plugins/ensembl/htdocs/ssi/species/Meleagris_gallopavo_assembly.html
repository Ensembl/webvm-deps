Turkey_2.01 (GCA_000146605.1) is an assembly of the domesticated turkey genome. The first 
sequences have been generated with the GS-Titanium platform in VBI's 
(<a href="https://www.vbi.vt.edu/">Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</a>) 
Core Lab. Additionally, the USDA 
(<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?MODECODE=12-00-00-00">United States Department of Agriculture</a>) 
Beltsville group provided 30x coverage with Illumina 70 bp reads. And the 
Salzberg group at UMD (<a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>) 
assisted with assembly and annotation of the integrated 454/Illumina/BAC end 
sequence data set into a "draft genome sequence". The whole composite covers 
90% of the genome.

The turkey genome is composed of 33 chromosomes, 
assembled from 152,913 contigs. The total number of bases in the genome 
is 1.04Gb.
