<p>Platyfish are members of the Poeciliidae family. The genus Xiphophorus is composed of 27 described species of
both platyfish and swordtails that are found from northeastern Mexico (Coahuila) as far south as Honduras (2200 km).
The Xiphophorus maculatus fish utilized for genome sequencing was a female of the 104th inbred generation from the
X. maculatus/Jp 163 A, a line maintained at The Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center. This release features the first
preliminary assembly of the X. maculatus/Jp 163 A genome, XipMac4.4.2, provided by The Genome Institute, Washington
University School of Medicine. This whole genome shotgun assembly was produced from two independent assemblies built
with all sequence data, using the Newbler and PCAP algorithms from ~19.6X total sequence coverage. A merged assembly
was achieved using graph accordance. The genome assembly displayed here comprises 20,640 scaffolds with an N50 of
1.3 Mb. These scaffolds have been assembled from a set of 67,070 contigs with an N50 of 22.3 kb. The final ungapped
sequence length is 653 Mb.<p>
