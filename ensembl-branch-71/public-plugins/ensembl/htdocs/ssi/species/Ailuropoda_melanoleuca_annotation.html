<p>
The gene set for panda was built using the Ensembl pipeline.
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of mammal proteins as
well as genetically distance proteins from other species, including
most vertebrate proteins from Uniprot. Additionally, dog and human
proteins were aligned using exonerate.</p>
<p>Potentially missing predictions and partial gene predictions were
identified by examining the orthologs, which were then used to build
new gene models.</p>
