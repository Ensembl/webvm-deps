<p>This site presents version 4 of the Fugu genome, released in June 2005 
by the <a href="http://www.fugu-sg.org/project/info.html">International Fugu Genome Consortium</a>. 
<i>Takifugu rubripes</i> has a very compact genome, with less than 15% consisting of dispersed 
repetitive sequence, which makes it ideal for gene discovery.</p>

<p>The latest assembly includes 7,213 scaffolds, constituting 390 Mb of the genome, and the 
mitochondrion. 90% of the genome is on 1118 scaffolds. 74 scaffolds are larger than 1 Mb each 
and the largest scaffold is 7 Mb.  Please refer to the 
<a href="http://www.fugu-sg.org">Fugu Project webpage</a> for more details of the sequencing effort.</p>
