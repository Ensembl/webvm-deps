This site presents the 6X whole genome shotgun assembly from a female Sumatran 
orangutan (<i>Pongo pygmaeus abelii</i>) named Susie, housed at the Gladys 
Porter Zoo (Brownsville, TX). 
The primary donor-derived reads were assembled using PCAP (Huang, 2006) 
using stringent parameters; by aligning the orangutan genome against the 
human genome, it was possible to identify interchromosomal cross-overs and
thus eliminate global mis-assemblies larger than 50kb.

Of the 3.09Gb of total sequence, 3.08Gb are ordered and oriented along
the chromosomes. Gap sizes between supercontigs were estimated based on
their size in human, with a maximum allowed gap size of 30kb.
