<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was
necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold"
super-structures, in order to present complete genes. There
are 8116 such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form
"GeneScaffold_1".</p>

<p>
<i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>).
The species were chosen to maximise the branch length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian species.</p>
                                                                                
<p>Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals and used in alignments for cross-species comparison.  The aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the human genome. <i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i> is of particular interest to developmental biologists owing to its habit of producing litters of four genetically-identical young, and it is also the animal model for leprosy.</p>
