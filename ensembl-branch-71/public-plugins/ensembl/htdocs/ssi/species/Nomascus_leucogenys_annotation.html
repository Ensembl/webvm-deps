<p>The gene set for gibbon was built using the Ensembl gene annotation pipeline.
Species-specific resources for gibbon are very limited and therefore sequences
from human were used as supporting evidence for coding transcript models: Gibbon
and human proteins were mapped to the genome using Genewise. Gibbon cDNAs, human
cDNAs and human Ensembl translations from e!61 were mapped to the genome using
Exonerate. In addition to the coding transcript models, non-coding RNAs and
pseudogenes were also annotated.</p>
