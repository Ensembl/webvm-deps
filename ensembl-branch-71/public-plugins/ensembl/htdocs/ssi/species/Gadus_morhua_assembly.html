This is the first draft sequence and assembly of the Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>), provided by the cod genome consortium. 
Whole genome shotgun and paired-end data were generated using the Roche 454 FLX Titanium platform. 
The 0.9 GB genome was sequenced to 25x coverage and assembled using Newbler, resulting in an assembly with a contig N50 of 2.3 kb and a scaffold N50 of 687.7 kb.
