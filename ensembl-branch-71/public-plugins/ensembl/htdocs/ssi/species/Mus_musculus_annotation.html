<p>
The mouse primary assembly GRCm38 was annotated using Ensembl's automatic annotation system. This includes an updated mouse-specific repeat library, RefSeq and Uniprot protein sequence data for annotating the coding regions of protein-coding genes, as well as mouse cDNAs and ESTs for annotation untranslated regions (UTRs) of protein-coding genes.
</p>

<p>
In current release, we continue to display a joint gene set based on the merge between the automatic annotation from Ensembl (May 2012) and the manually curated annotation from <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/index.html">Havana</a>. Transcripts from the two annotation sources were merged if they shared the same internal exon-intron boundaries (i.e. had identical splicing pattern) with slight differences in the terminal exons allowed. Importantly, all Vega source transcripts (regardless of merge status) were included in the final merged gene set.
</p>

<p>
In this release, 24200 Ensembl genes and 22935 Havana genes were
merged to create a final set of 38293 genes. Most of the Ensembl-only
annotated genes represent protein coding models in genomic regions
where manual annotation is not available. While most of the
Havana-only annotated genes are psuedogenes and long non-coding RNA
genes.

<p>
In addition to the gene set, we display alignments of mouse cDNA and EST sequences. The mouse cDNA alignments are updated for every Ensembl release. We also display alignments of sequences from UniProt, UniGene and the ENA vertebrate RNA collection, and ab initio gene predictions from Genscan. The Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) identifiers have also been mapped to the new assembly. More information about the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi">CCDS</a> project.
