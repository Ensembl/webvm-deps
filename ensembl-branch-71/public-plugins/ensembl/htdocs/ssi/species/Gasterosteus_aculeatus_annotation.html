<p>The gene set for stickleback was built using a modified version of the 
standard Ensembl genebuild pipeline. The majority of gene models are 
based on genewise alignments of proteins from species genetically 
distant from stickleback. To improve accuracy, genewise alignments were 
made to stretches of genomic sequence rather than to 'miniseqs'. cDNA  
and EST sequences were used to add UTR to genes with 3' and 5' ESTs from 
the same clone being paired where possible.</p>
<p>The quality of the gene models was assessed by generating sets of 
potential orthologs to genes from other species. Potentially missing 
predictions and partial gene predictions were identified by examining 
the orthologs and used to improve the gene models. 2,208 cDNAs from 
Stanford Human Genome Center were used to further assess quality before 
being incorporated into the final gene set.</p>
