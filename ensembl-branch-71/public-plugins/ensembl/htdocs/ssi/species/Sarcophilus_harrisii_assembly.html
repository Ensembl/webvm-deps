This site displays the DEVIL7.0 assembly (GCA_000219685.1) of the Tasmanian devil (<i>Sarcophilus harrisii</i>) genome. 
The genome sequence and assembly are provided by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> 
and <a href="http://www.illumina.com">Illumina</a>.  
  
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 
size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 1847.19 kb and is  20.13 kb for contigs. 
The total number of bases in supercontigs is 3.17 Gb and in contigs is 2.93 Gb.
