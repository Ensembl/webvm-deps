Mmul_1 is a preliminary assembly of the Indian-origin rhesus monkey, <i>Macaca mulatta</i> 
using whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads from small and medium insert clones.
Several WGS libraries, with inserts of 2-4 kb and 10 kb, fosmids with ~35kb 
inserts, and BACs with 180kb inserts were used to produce the data.

The release was produced by the Macaque Genome Sequencing Consortium, led by
the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/rmacaque/">Baylor College 
of Human Medicine</a>, melding three separate complementary assemblies (created using the Atlas, Celera and
PCAP systems). This involved iteratively splitting likely chimeric scaffolds
and joining together existing scaffolds where possible. Chimeric scaffolds 
(<100 total) were identified by breaks in synteny with the human genome, which
were confirmed to be artefacts by the other assemblies.

This is a draft sequence and may contain errors so users should exercise
caution. Typical errors in draft genome sequences include
misassemblies of repeated sequences, collapses of repeated regions,
and unmerged overlaps (e.g. due to polymorphisms) creating artificial
duplications. However base accuracy in contigs (contiguous blocks of
sequence) is usually very high with most errors near the ends of
contigs. [<a href ="ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/data/Rmacaque/fasta/README03272007.txt">More about the assembly</a>].
