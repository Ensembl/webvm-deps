The <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/4/R42">UMD 3.1 assembly</a> (NCBI assembly accesion 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Bos_taurus/Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1">GCA_000003055.3</a>), 
released in December 2009, is the third release of the cow (<i>Bos taurus</i>) assembly from the 
<a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/research/bos_taurus_assembly.shtml">Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CBCB)</a>
 at University of Maryland.  The genome sequences were generated using a combination of BAC-by-BAC hierarchical (~11 million reads) 
and whole-genome shotgun (~24 million reads) sequencing methods, assembled using the Celera Assembler version 5.2.

<p>
The total length of the UMD3.1 assembly is 2.65Gb. The N50 size is the median sequence length, i.e. 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 
size or longer. The N50 size for contigs in the UMD3.1 assembly is 103785.
