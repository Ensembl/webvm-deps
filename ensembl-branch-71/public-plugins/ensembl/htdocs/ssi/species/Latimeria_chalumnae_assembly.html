This is the preliminary display of the Coelacanth (<i>Latimeria chalumnae</i>) genome produced by the 
<a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/projects/mammals-models/vertebrates-invertebrates/coelacanth/coelacanth">Broad Institute</a>. 
Illumina techology was used to produced this high quality draft. The whole genome shotgun data was assembled with Allpaths. 
The genome is 2.9gb in length;,composed of 291,828 contigs with an N50 value of 12.6kb and 22,818 scaffolds with an N50 value of 765kb.
