<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, 
it was necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" 
super-structures, in order to present complete genes. There are 
7722 such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".

<h3>Mammalian Genome Project</h3>
<p><i>Procavia capensis</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the
Mammalian Genome Project, funded by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH). A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch length of
the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian
species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals
and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The aim is to
increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the
human genome.
