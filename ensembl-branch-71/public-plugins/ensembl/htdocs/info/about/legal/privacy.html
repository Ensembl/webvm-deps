<h1>Ensembl Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>Information provided to or gathered by ensembl.org is controlled by the Ensembl Project, a 
collaboration between the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>
and the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a>, based near Cambridge, UK.</p>

<p>Ensembl.org gathers information about users solely to improve the usability and usefulness of the site,
and not for any commercial purposes. No use is made of users' contact information except when
directly requested by them, e.g. to sign up for a mailing list or activate a user account.
Other information collected during the course of your usage of the site, such as pages visited, may be
collected in server log files and used for statistical analysis of traffic patterns.</p>

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>Ensembl and its Sanger-based satellite sites (including archives, Pre! and Vega) conform to the
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/legal/cookiespolicy.html">Sanger Institute cookie policy</a>. Please
see this document for an explanation of the types of cookies we set.</p>

<p>The specific cookies set by Ensembl are listed below. Note that older archives will not set some
cookies as they lack the functionality the cookie was designed to configure.</p>

<h2>Additional information held in user accounts</h2>

<p>All Ensembl data that is publically available for download is also freely available via the website.
For the convenience of users we have introduced a wholly voluntary system of user accounts, through which
we can offer additional services such as saved configurations and user groups.</p>

<p>Of necessity, all user accounts are accessible to the Ensembl web database administrators. However
passwords are stored in one-way encrypted format and cannot be retrieved by staff.</p>

<p>The public release of the Ensembl database includes a <strong>blank</strong> copy of the user database,
for use in setting up a local copy if required. Also, unlike the rest of the Ensembl codebase, the account
system can only be extended in limited ways, to prevent abuse of systems that may be less secure than
ensembl.org.</p>

<!--
<h2>User groups</h2>

<p>Each user group has one or more administrators, who manage shared settings for members. The availability
of contact information to other members of a group varies as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Open groups</strong> are those which can be joined by anyone at any time. These groups are
administered by Ensembl staff, who will be able to see the list of user names and email addresses. Other 
members of these groups will not be able to see your name or email address.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted groups</strong> are moderated by an administrator. To join the group, you have to 
request membership. All members of the group will be able to see your name, and in addition the administrator 
will be able to email you. [You may still keep your email address private if desired.]</p>

<p><strong>Private groups</strong> are similar to restricted ones, except that membership is by invitation
only. These groups are thus not listed on pages other than those belonging to existing members.</p>
