<h1>Changes to Ensembl Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>
In 2012 we changed the way that the ensembl-dev and ensembl-announce mailing lists are managed.
</p>

<p>
The following list addresses changed with the move:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>ensembl-dev@ebi.ac.uk became <strong>dev@ensembl.org</strong></li>

  <li>ensembl-announce@ebi.ac.uk became <strong>announce@ensembl.org</strong></li>
 
</ul>

<p>All subscribers to the old lists have been moved to the new lists. Information about the new lists, including details on how to subscribe and unsubscribe, can be found at <a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo">http://lists.ensembl.org/</a>.</p>

<p>As before, dev@ensembl.org is an open list which any subscriber can post to. Posting to announce@ensembl.org is restricted to Ensembl people.</p>
