  <h2>Stable Identifiers</h2>

  <p>
    Stable identifiers, in Ensembl, are mapped between re-annotation 
    processes using a combination of location based mappings and 
    those generated by <a href='http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/'>
    Exonerate</a>. The process performs exon based mapping and deriving 
    subsequent identifier mappings based upon these findings. Stable 
    identifiers can also be versioned depending upon the presence of 
    change between an old and new entity deemed similar enough to have 
    the identifier transfered. These rules are elaborated in 
    our <a href='stable_id_versions.html'>stable id versioning document</a>.
